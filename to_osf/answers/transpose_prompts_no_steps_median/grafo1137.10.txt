Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [5, 3]
Layer 2: [9, 7, 8]
Layer 3: [6, 1, 2, 4]

Note:

For Layer 0, there is only one node, so it is already sorted.
For Layer 1, node 5 has no neighbors in the next layer, so it is assigned a median of 0.
For Layer 2, node 9 has only one neighbor in the next layer, so it is assigned the same position as that neighbor. Nodes 7 and 8 both have two neighbors in the next layer, so their median position is the average of the positions of their neighbors.
For Layer 3, all nodes have two neighbors in the previous layer, so their median position is the average of the positions of their neighbors.
