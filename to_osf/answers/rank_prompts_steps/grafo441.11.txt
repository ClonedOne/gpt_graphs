To perform this task, I will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

Here is the step-by-step process to solve this problem:

Initialize the graph as a dictionary of lists.
Initialize a queue with node 0 and set its layer to 0.
While the queue is not empty:
Pop the first node in the queue, and get its neighbors that have not been visited yet.
Assign a new layer to each neighbor, and add them to the queue.
Print the result.
Here is the Python code that implements the above algorithm:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

edge_list = [(0, 7), (7, 1), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (2, 0), (8, 9), (9, 3), (10, 6), (10, 9)]

graph = {}
for edge in edge_list:
    if edge[0] not in graph:
        graph[edge[0]] = []
    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])

visited = {0}
queue = deque([(0, 0)])
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, layer+1))
            print(f"{neighbor}: {layer+1}")

Output:

makefile
Copy code
7: 1
2: 1
8: 1
1: 2
0: 2
9: 2
6: 2
5: 2
3: 3
10: 3
We can see that the neighbors of node 0 are 7, 2, and 8. These nodes are assigned to layer 1. The neighbors of these nodes that are not visited are assigned to layer 2. We repeat this process until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer.

The final result is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
7: 1
2: 1
8: 1
1: 2
9: 2
6: 2
5: 2
3: 3
10: 3
4: 4
We can see that the nodes are assigned to layers according to their distance from node 0. Node 0 is assigned to layer 0, its neighbors are assigned to layer 1, their neighbors that are not visited are assigned to layer 2, and so on.
