Starting from node 0, we can build the layer by layer graph using breadth-first search. Here's the step-by-step process:

Layer 0: 0

Layer 1: 1, 10

Layer 2: 7

Layer 3: 6, 0, 2, 3, 4

Layer 4: 9

Layer 5: 5

Since all nodes have been assigned a layer, we have completed the process. Here's the final result:
