Starting from node 0, we can follow the edges and assign layers to the nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Initially, node 0 belongs to layer 0.

Layer 1:

Node 6 (0 -> 6)
Node 5 (0 -> 5)
Layer 2:

Node 1 (6 -> 1)
Layer 3:

Node 9 (6 -> 9)
Layer 4:

Node 2 (7 -> 2)
Node 4 (7 -> 4)
Layer 5:

Node 8 (3 -> 8)
Node 10 (10 -> 5, 10 -> 8, 10 -> 1)
Note that node 7 is not included in any of the layers as it is not connected to node 0.

The final result, with all nodes and their corresponding layers, is:

0: 0
6: 1
5: 1
1: 2
9: 3
2: 4
4: 4
8: 5
10: 5
3: 6
7: -1
Note that node 7 is not reachable from node 0, so it is not included in any of the layers and is assigned a layer of -1.
