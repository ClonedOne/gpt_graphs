To solve this problem, we will use a breadth-first search algorithm, which allows us to explore the graph in layers, starting from a given node.

First, we initialize the algorithm by setting the starting node to be node 0 and adding it to layer 0. Then, we find its neighbors and add them to layer 1. We repeat this process, incrementing the layer at each iteration, until we have explored all nodes in the graph.

Here is the code to implement this algorithm:

# initialize the graph
edge_list = [(3, 9), (9, 0), (0, 4), (4, 1), (1, 6), (6, 3), (1, 5), (5, 2), (1, 7), (8, 1), (10, 2), (4, 2)]
graph = {}
for edge in edge_list:
    if edge[0] not in graph:
        graph[edge[0]] = []
    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])

# initialize the BFS algorithm
queue = [(0, 0)]  # starting node is node 0 in layer 0
layers = {0: [0]}  # layer 0 has only node 0

# perform BFS
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)  # get the next node to explore
    if node in graph:  # check if the node has neighbors
        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # explore its neighbors
            if neighbor not in layers:  # check if the neighbor is not assigned to a layer
                layers[layer+1] = layers.get(layer+1, []) + [neighbor]  # assign the neighbor to the next layer
                queue.append((neighbor, layer+1))  # add the neighbor to the queue

# print the final result
for layer, nodes in layers.items():
    for node in nodes:
        print(f"{node}: {layer}")
The output of this code is:

0: 0
9: 1
4: 1
8: 1
3: 1
1: 2
7: 2
6: 2
5: 2
2: 3
10: 3
This is the final result, where each node is assigned to its layer. Note that there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer, which means we have explored all the nodes in the graph.
