Using the given edge list, we can construct the following graph:

10 ---| 
      v
 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
 ^    |    ^    |
 |    v    |    v
  --- 6 -> 7 -> 8
       ^

       v
      3
Starting from node 0, we can perform a breadth-first search to find all nodes and their layers. We will use a dictionary to store the layer for each node. Initially, only node 0 is in layer 0.

Copy code
layers = {0: 0}
Next, we will find the neighbors of node 0, which are nodes 1 and 10, and assign them to layer 1.

css
Copy code
layers.update({1: 1, 10: 1})
The nodes in layer 1 are:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
10: 1
Next, we will find the neighbors of nodes 1 and 10 that do not already belong to a layer, and assign them to layer 2. The neighbors of node 1 are nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8. The neighbors of node 10 are node 9.

yaml
Copy code
layers.update({2: 2, 5: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 2})
The nodes in layer 2 are:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
10: 1
2: 2
5: 2
7: 2
8: 2
9: 2
Next, we will find the neighbors of nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 that do not already belong to a layer, and assign them to layer 3. The neighbors of node 2 are node 4 and 9. The neighbors of node 5 are node 4. The neighbors of node 7 are node 8. The neighbors of node 8 are node 1. The neighbors of node 9 do not have any new nodes that are not already in a layer.

css
Copy code
layers.update({4: 3, 1: 3})
The nodes in layer 3 are:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
10: 1
2: 2
5: 2
7: 2
8: 2
9: 2
4: 3
3: 4
Next, we will find the neighbors of nodes 4, 1, and 3 that do not already belong to a layer, and assign them to layer 4. The neighbors of node 4 do not have any new nodes that are not already in a layer. The neighbors of node 1 are nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8. The neighbors of node 3 are node 4 and 1.

yaml
Copy code
layers.update({2: 4, 5: 4, 7: 4, 8: 4})
The nodes in layer 4 are:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
10: 1
2: 2
5: 2
7: 2
8: 2
9: 2
4: 3
3: 4
2: 4
5: 4
7: 4
8: 4
Next, we will find the neighbors of nodes 2, 5, 7,
