Using the given edge_list, we can create a directed graph to visualize the connections:

rust
Copy code
       4 --> 2 --\
       ^         |
       |         v
       10       5 --> 1 --> 6 --> 9
        \      ^      |
         \    /       v
           0        7 --> 3 --> 8
Starting from node 0, we can use breadth-first search to assign a layer number to each node based on their distance from node 0. We start by assigning layer 0 to node 0, and then proceed to assign layer numbers to its neighbors.

yaml
Copy code
Layer 0:
0: 0

Layer 1:
7: 1

Layer 2:
3: 2
9: 2

Layer 3:
1: 3
8: 3

Layer 4:
2: 4
5: 4

Layer 5:
4: 5
6: 5
10: 5
Continuing the process until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer, we get the final result:

yaml
Copy code
Layer 0:
0: 0

Layer 1:
7: 1

Layer 2:
3: 2
9: 2

Layer 3:
1: 3
8: 3

Layer 4:
2: 4
5: 4

Layer 5:
4: 5
6: 5
10: 5

Layer 6:
Therefore, all nodes in the graph have been assigned a layer number.
