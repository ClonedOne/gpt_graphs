Starting from node 0 and following the given edge list, we can perform a breadth-first search to determine the layers of each node in the graph. We will maintain a queue of nodes to visit next and a dictionary to store the layer of each visited node. We will start by assigning node 0 to layer 0 and adding its neighbors to the queue with layer 1.

queue = [(0, 0)]
visited = {0: 0}
edge_list = [(2, 3), (0, 3), (4, 5), (6, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (1, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (2, 8), (6, 4), (9, 3)]

# Find neighbors of node 0 and assign them to layer 1
for u, v in edge_list:
    if u == 0:
        queue.append((v, 1))
        visited[v] = 1
Next, we will iterate through the queue, adding the neighbors of each node to the next layer if they have not already been visited.

layer = 1
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u == node and v not in visited:
            queue.append((v, layer + 1))
            visited[v] = layer + 1
We can repeat this process until there are no more unvisited nodes. The resulting layers for each node are:

0: 0
3: 1
1: 1
Next, we will find the neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that have not already been assigned to a layer, and assign them to layer 2.

# Find neighbors of nodes in layer 1 and assign them to layer 2
for node in visited:
    if visited[node] == 1:
        for u, v in edge_list:
            if u == node and v not in visited:
                queue.append((v, 2))
                visited[v] = 2
We can repeat the process for each subsequent layer until there are no more unvisited nodes.

yaml
Copy code
# Find neighbors of nodes in layer 2 and assign them to layer 3
layer = 3
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u == node and v not in visited:
            queue.append((v, layer + 1))
            visited[v] = layer + 1

# Find neighbors of nodes in layer 3 and assign them to layer 4
layer = 4
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u == node and v not in visited:
            queue.append((v, layer + 1))
            visited[v] = layer + 1

# Find neighbors of nodes in layer 4 and assign them to layer 5
layer = 5
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u == node and v not in visited:
            queue.append((v, layer + 1))
            visited[v] = layer + 1
The final layers for each node are:

0: 0

7: 2
8: 2
2: 3
