Starting from node 0 and following the steps provided, we can find the layers of each node in the graph. Here's the solution:

Starting from node 0: layer 0
Neighbors of node 0: 5
Nodes in layer 1:
makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
Neighbors of nodes in layer 1: 6
Nodes in layer 2:
makefile
Copy code
1: 1
6: 2
Neighbors of nodes in layer 2: 2, 9
Nodes in layer 3:
makefile
Copy code
2: 3
9: 3
Neighbors of nodes in layer 3: 7, 8, 3
Nodes in layer 4:
makefile
Copy code
3: 4
7: 4
8: 4
Neighbors of nodes in layer 4:
Nodes in layer 5:
makefile
Copy code
4: 5
There are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer, so we're done. The final result is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
1: 1
6: 2
2: 3
9: 3
3: 4
7: 4
8: 4
4: 5
