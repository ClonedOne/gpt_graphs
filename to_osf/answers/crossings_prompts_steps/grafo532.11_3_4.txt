Based on the provided information, we have a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices A and B. A has two vertices with values 5 and 8, while B has one vertex with value 3. There is a single edge between vertex 5 in set A and vertex 3 in set B.

Since there is only one edge, we can directly write down the answer as 0 and stop.

Therefore, the number of edge crossings in this bipartite graph is 0.
