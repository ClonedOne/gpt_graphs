First, we need to create the bipartite graph based on the given arrays and edges. The graph will have two sets of nodes, one set for array A and one set for array B. The edges will connect nodes from set A to nodes from set B.

makefile
Copy code
A: [0]
B: [7, 6, 10]

Edges:
(0, 7)
(0, 6)
(0, 10)
The bipartite graph will look like this:

css
Copy code
  A | B
  -----
  0 | 7
  0 | 6
  0 | 10
We can see that there is only one edge, so the answer is 0.

If there were more edges, we would proceed with the following steps:

Exclude all pairs that have the same first element:
scss
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 10)
Exclude all pairs that have the same second element:
scss
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 10)
Consider every pair of edges left and write down s1, t1, s2, and t2 for every pair:
javascript
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 6) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2
(0, 7), (0, 10) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
(0, 6), (0, 10) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
Exclude all pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
We can see that all pairs satisfy this condition, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Exclude all pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
We can see that all pairs satisfy this condition, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Finally, we are left with three pairs of edges. Therefore, the number of edges left is 3.
