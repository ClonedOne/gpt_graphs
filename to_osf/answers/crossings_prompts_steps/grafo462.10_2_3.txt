Based on the input data, we have a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, A and B, and a single edge connecting vertex 3 in set A to vertex 9 in set B. Therefore, there is only one edge in the graph, and the answer is 0.

However, if there were more than one edge, we would follow the steps described in the prompt to count the number of edge crossings.
