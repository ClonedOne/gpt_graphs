Based on the given arrays A and B and the list of edges, we can create a bipartite graph where the nodes on the left side correspond to the elements in A and the nodes on the right side correspond to the elements in B. The edges connect the nodes from A to nodes in B as specified in the list of tuples.

Since there is only one edge, the answer is 0.

If array A has length 1 or array B has length 1, the answer is also 0.

Otherwise, we need to consider all pairs of edges, exclude the pairs that have the same first or second element, and then apply the additional conditions.

The list of pairs of edges with distinct first and second elements is:

[(1, 4)]

Here, s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 0 for the only pair.

There is only one pair, and s1 is not greater than s2 nor is t1 less than t2, so we do not need to exclude any pairs. Therefore, the final answer is 1.
