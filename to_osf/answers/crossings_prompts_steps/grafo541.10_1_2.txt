Following the instructions, here are the steps to count the number of edge crossings in the given bipartite graph:

Step 1: We have two arrays A and B, and a list of edges. A has one element, so we can stop here and write 0.

Answer: 0

Step 2: We don't need to exclude any pairs that have the same first or second element, since there is only one edge.

Answer: (5, 9), (5, 3)

Step 3: Since there are only two edges, we only have one pair of edges left. We can compute the indices s1, t1, s2, and t2 as follows:

(5, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1
(5, 3) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 0

Step 4: We can see that none of the remaining pairs satisfy s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Answer: 1 (there is only one pair of edges left)
