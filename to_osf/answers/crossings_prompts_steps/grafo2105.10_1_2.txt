Using the given arrays A and B and the list of edges, we can create the bipartite graph G = (A, B, E) where E is the set of edges defined by the given tuples.

For a pair of edges e1 = (a1, b1) and e2 = (a2, b2), we say that they cross if a1 < a2 and b1 > b2, or if a1 > a2 and b1 < b2. In other words, they cross if they form an "X" shape in the bipartite graph.

If there is a single edge or one of the arrays has length 1, there can be no edge crossings, so the answer is 0.

Otherwise, we need to consider all pairs of edges and exclude those that have the same first or second element. This gives us the following pairs of edges:

(3, 2), (3, 4)
(3, 2), (3, 9)
(3, 4), (3, 9)

Next, we need to exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, as well as pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. For each pair, we compute the indices s1, t1, s2, and t2 as described in the prompt:

(3, 2), (3, 4) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2 (exclude)
(3, 2), (3, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 0 (exclude)
(3, 2), (3, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2 (exclude)
(3, 4), (3, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 2 (exclude)

So, there are no pairs of edges that cross, and the answer is 0.
