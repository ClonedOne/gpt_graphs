Based on the given arrays A and B, and the list of edges, there are two edges: (3, 10) and (3, 4). Since there is only one edge, the answer is 0 as per the instruction.

However, if there were multiple edges, the following steps can be followed to count the edge crossings in the bipartite graph:

First, we exclude all pairs of edges that have the same first element, and write down the remaining pairs:
Remaining pairs: [(3, 10), (3, 4)]

Next, we exclude all pairs of edges that have the same second element, and write down the remaining pairs:
Remaining pairs: [(3, 10), (3, 4)]

For each pair of remaining edges, we determine the indices of their elements in arrays A and B as follows:
(3, 10) => s1=1, t1=0, s2=0, t2=1
(3, 4) => s1=1, t1=1, s2=0, t2=0

We exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
Remaining pairs: [(3, 10), (3, 4)]

We exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
Remaining pairs: [(3, 10), (3, 4)]

Finally, we count the number of remaining edges, which is 2.
Therefore, in this case, the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph is 2.
