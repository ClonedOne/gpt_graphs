First, let's check the conditions. As there are two edges, we can proceed. Also, since array A has more than one element and array B has more than one element, we can proceed with the edge crossings calculation.

To begin, we can visualize the bipartite graph with the given arrays and edges as follows:

yaml
Copy code
   A: [1, 2, 9, 4]
   B: [5, 8]
   
   1 -|
   2 -|- 5
   9 -|
   4 -|- 8
We can see that there are two edges crossing in the graph, from vertex 2 in A to vertex 5 in B, and from vertex 4 in A to vertex 8 in B. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Now let's follow the steps outlined in the prompt to get the same answer:

Exclude pairs with the same first element:

No pairs to exclude.
Exclude pairs with the same second element:

No pairs to exclude.
Write down s1, t1, s2, and t2 for each pair:

(2, 1, 4, 2) for the pair (2, 5) and (4, 8)
Exclude pairs with s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:

No pairs to exclude.
Exclude pairs with s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

No pairs to exclude.
Since no pairs were excluded in steps 1-5, the number of edge crossings is still 2.
