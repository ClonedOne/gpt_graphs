First, we create a bipartite graph with the given arrays and edges.

yaml
Copy code
   A: [3, 1]
   B: [6, 4, 7]

    3  -->(6)
   / \
  |   \
  |   (4)
  |   
  1  -->(7)
Since there are multiple edges, we continue with the counting process.

Exclude all pairs that have the same first element:

(3, 6), (1, 7)
Exclude all pairs that have the same second element:

(3, 6), (3, 4)
(1, 7), (3, 6)
(1, 7), (3, 4)
Consider the first edge in each remaining pair and note their indices:

(3, 6), (1, 7) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=1, t2=2
(3, 6), (3, 4) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=0, t2=1
(1, 7), (3, 6) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=0, t2=0
(1, 7), (3, 4) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=0, t2=1
Exclude pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:

(3, 6), (3, 4) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=0, t2=1
(1, 7), (3, 4) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=0, t2=1
Exclude pairs where s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

(3, 6), (3, 4) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=0, t2=1
Only one edge pair remains, which is (1, 7), (3, 6). Therefore, the final answer is 1.
