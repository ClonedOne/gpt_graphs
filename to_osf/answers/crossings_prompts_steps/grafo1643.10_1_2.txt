First, we can see that there is only one edge, so we can write 0 and stop writing.

If there were multiple edges, we would proceed as follows:

Excluding pairs with the same first element:
There are no such pairs, since all edges have different first elements.

Excluding pairs with the same second element:
There are no such pairs, since all edges have different second elements.

Consider every pair of edges and write down s1, t1, s2, and t2:
There is only one edge, so we do not need to consider any pairs.

Excluding pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
There are no such pairs, since there is only one edge.

Excluding pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
There are no such pairs, since there is only one edge.

Therefore, the number of edges left is 0.
