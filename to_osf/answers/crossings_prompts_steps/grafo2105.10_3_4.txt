Based on the given arrays and edges, here are the steps to count the number of edge crossings:

Check if there is only one edge or if array A or B has length 1. If any of these conditions is met, the result is 0 and we can stop writing.
Since we have two edges and array B has length 1, we need to continue with the remaining steps.

Consider all pairs of edges and exclude pairs that have the same first or second element.
The only pair of edges is [(1, 7), (8, 7)].

For each remaining pair of edges, find the indices of the first and second elements in arrays A and B.
For the pair [(1, 7), (8, 7)]:

s1 = index of 1 in A = 2
t1 = index of 7 in B = 1
s2 = index of 8 in A = 0
t2 = index of 7 in B = 1
Exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, and pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2.
There is only one pair left, so we don't need to exclude any more pairs.

Write the number of edges left.
There is only one edge left, so the final result is 1.

Therefore, the number of edge crossings in the given bipartite graph is 1.
