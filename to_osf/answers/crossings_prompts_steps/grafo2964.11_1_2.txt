First, let's visualize the bipartite graph using the arrays and edges provided:

css
Copy code
  A   B
 / \ /|\
9   3 1 2
 \ / \|/
  4
Since there is only one edge, the answer is 0.

If either array A or B has length 1, the answer is also 0.

Assuming that neither array A nor B has length 1, we proceed to count the number of edge crossings as follows:

First, we exclude all pairs of edges that have the same first element or the same second element. After doing this, the remaining pairs of edges are:
css
Copy code
[(9, 3), (4, 1)]
[(9, 3), (4, 2)]
[(4, 1), (9, 3)]
[(4, 2), (9, 3)]
[(4, 1), (4, 2)]
[(4, 2), (4, 1)]
For each pair of edges left, we consider the indices of their elements in arrays A and B, as follows:
markdown
Copy code
(9, 3) and (4, 1):
  - s1 = 0 (index of 9 in A)
  - t1 = 0 (index of 3 in B)
  - s2 = 1 (index of 4 in A)
  - t2 = 1 (index of 1 in B)

(9, 3) and (4, 2):
  - s1 = 0
  - t1 = 0
  - s2 = 1
  - t2 = 2 (index of 2 in B)

(4, 1) and (9, 3):
  - s1 = 1
  - t1 = 1
  - s2 = 0
  - t2 = 0

(4, 2) and (9, 3):
  - s1 = 1
  - t1 = 2
  - s2 = 0
  - t2 = 0

(4, 1) and (4, 2):
  - s1 = 1
  - t1 = 1
  - s2 = 1
  - t2 = 2

(4, 2) and (4, 1):
  - s1 = 1
  - t1 = 2
  - s2 = 1
  - t2 = 1
Finally, we exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. After doing this, we are left with the following pairs of edges:
css
Copy code
[(9, 3), (4, 1)]
[(4, 1), (4, 2)]
[(4, 2), (9, 3)]
Therefore, the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph is 3.
