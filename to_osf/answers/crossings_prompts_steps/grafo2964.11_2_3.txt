First, we can count the number of edges given:

Number of edges = 7

Next, we need to exclude the cases where there is only one edge or either array A or array B has length 1:

Number of edges = 7 (after checking conditions)

Since both arrays A and B have more than one element, we can proceed with the next steps.

Excluding pairs with the same first element:

Pairs after excluding edges with the same first element:
[(1, 6), (3, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 10)]

Excluding pairs with the same second element:

Pairs after excluding edges with the same second element:
[(1, 6), (3, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 10)]

Now, we need to consider every pair of edges left and write down s1, t1, s2 and t2 for every pair:

(1, 6), (3, 6): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 3, t2 = 1
(1, 6), (1, 5): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 2
(1, 6), (2, 5): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 2, t2 = 2
(1, 6), (1, 7): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 3
(1, 6), (1, 8): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 4
(1, 6), (2, 10): s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 2, t2 = 5
(3, 6), (1, 5): s1 = 3, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 2
(3, 6), (2, 5): s1 = 3, t1 = 1, s2 = 2, t2 = 2
(3, 6), (1, 7): s1 = 3, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 3
(3, 6), (1, 8): s1 = 3, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 4
(3, 6), (2, 10): s1 = 3, t1 = 1, s2 = 2, t2 = 5
(1, 5), (2, 5): s1 = 1, t1 = 2, s2 = 2, t2 = 2
(1, 5), (1, 7): s1 = 1, t1 = 2, s2 = 1, t2 = 3
(1, 5), (1, 8): s1 = 1, t1 = 2, s2 = 1, t2 = 4
(1, 5), (2, 10): s1 = 1, t1 = 2, s2 = 2, t2 = 5
