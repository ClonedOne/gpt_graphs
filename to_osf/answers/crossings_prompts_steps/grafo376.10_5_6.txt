The given graph is a bipartite graph with two disjoint sets A and B, where A = [8, 9] and B = [4, 5]. The edges are [(8, 4), (9, 5)].

There is a single edge, so the answer is 0 and we can stop here.

If there were more than one edge, and both A and B had more than one element, we would proceed as follows:

First, we exclude pairs of edges that have the same first element or the same second element:
Pairs left: [(8, 4), (9, 5)]

Next, we consider every pair of remaining edges and record their indices:
(8, 4), (9, 5) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 1

We exclude the pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
Pairs left: [(8, 4), (9, 5)]

We exclude the pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
Pairs left: [(8, 4), (9, 5)]

There is only one edge left, so the final answer is 1.
