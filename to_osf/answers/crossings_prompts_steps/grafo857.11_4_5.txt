The given graph is a bipartite graph with two sets of nodes, A and B, and the edges connect the nodes in A with the nodes in B.

First, we check the conditions stated in the prompt. Since there are only two edges, we don't need to perform any calculations and can directly write the answer as 0.

If there were more than two edges, we would need to consider all combinations of pairs of edges. However, in this case, we only have two edges, and thus there is only one possible pair of edges.

So the final answer is 0.
