First, we can see that there is a single edge, so the answer is 0.

If there were more edges, we would follow the steps as instructed:

Excluding pairs with the same first element:
We are left with all the pairs.

Excluding pairs with the same second element:
We are left with all the pairs.

Writing s1, t1, s2, and t2 for each pair:
(9, 2) and (9, 3) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2
(9, 2) and (9, 8) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
(9, 2) and (9, 6) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 4
(9, 2) and (9, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 5
(9, 3) and (9, 8) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
(9, 3) and (9, 6) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 4
(9, 3) and (9, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 5
(9, 8) and (9, 6) => s1 = 0, t1 = 3, s2 = 0, t2 = 4
(9, 8) and (9, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 3, s2 = 0, t2 = 5
(9, 6) and (9, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 4, s2 = 0, t2 = 5

Excluding pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
None of the pairs satisfy this condition, so we keep all pairs.

Excluding pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
None of the pairs satisfy this condition, so we keep all pairs.

Therefore, if there were more edges, we would be left with 10 pairs of edges after performing all the exclusions, and the number of edge crossings would be 10. However, since there is only one edge, the answer is 0.
