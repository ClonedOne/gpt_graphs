Following the steps given in the question, we can solve this problem as follows:

Step 1: We have the following edges:
[(7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2)]
Since there are multiple edges, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: We exclude the pairs that have the same first or second element, which gives us the following edges:
[(7, 2), (8, 2)]
Note that the pair (7, 4) has been excluded because it has the same first element as (7, 2).

Step 3: For every pair of edges, we write down s1, t1, s2, and t2:
(7, 2) and (8, 2) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 1
Note that s1 and s2 correspond to the indices of the first element in A, and t1 and t2 correspond to the indices of the second element in B.

Step 4: We exclude the pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, which in this case is none.

Step 5: We exclude the pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2, which in this case is also none.

Step 6: We count the number of edges left, which is 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2.
