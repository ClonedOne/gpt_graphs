Based on the arrays and edges provided, there is only one edge in the bipartite graph, so the number of edge crossings is 0.

Note: As stated in the prompt, if there is a single edge, we do not need to consider any pairs of edges or perform any further calculations. Similarly, if either array A or B has a length of 1, we can also conclude that there are no edge crossings without performing any additional calculations.
