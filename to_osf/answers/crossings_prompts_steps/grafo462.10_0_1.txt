Based on the given arrays and list of edges, we can visualize the bipartite graph as follows:

     A
     |
     0
    /|\
 B 6 8 7
We can see that there is only one edge in this graph, so the answer is 0, as requested in the prompt.

Note that if either array A or B had a length of 1, the answer would also be 0, regardless of the number of edges. This is because in a bipartite graph, all edges must connect a vertex in A to a vertex in B, so there are no opportunities for edge crossings.

If there were more than one edge in the graph, we would proceed as follows:

Exclude pairs with the same first element: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]
Exclude pairs with the same second element: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]
For each remaining pair of edges, compute the indices s1, t1, s2, and t2 as follows:
(0, 8) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2
(0, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 1
Exclude pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]
Exclude pairs where s1 < s2 and t1 > t2: []
The final list of pairs is: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]
The number of edges left is 2.
However, since there is only one edge in this graph, the answer is 0.
