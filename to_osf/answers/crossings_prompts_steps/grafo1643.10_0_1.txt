Given the arrays A = [0] and B = [1, 4], and the list of edges [(0, 1), (0, 4)], we need to count the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph.

Since there are only two edges, we can stop here and write the answer as 0.

Explanation:

There is only one edge crossing in this case, since both edges share a common vertex (0 in A).
As array A has length 1, we can stop writing.
Since there are two elements in array B, we need to consider all pairs of edges.
There are two pairs of edges: (0,1)-(0,4)
We exclude the pairs with the same first or second element, so only (0,1)-(0,4) remains.
We compare the indices of the elements in each pair of edges: s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 4.
The condition s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 is not satisfied, so we don't exclude this pair.
The condition s1 < s2 and t1 > t2 is not satisfied either, so we don't exclude this pair either.
The final number of edges left is 2, but as there is only one pair of edges, the answer is 0.
