Following the instructions provided, we can first create the list of edges from the given tuples:

css
Copy code
A = [3, 10]
B = [8]
edges = [(a, b) for a in A for b in B]
edges_tuples = [(3, 8)]
Since there is only one edge, we can stop here and write the answer as 0.

If there were more edges, we would proceed with the remaining steps as follows:

python
Copy code
# Exclude pairs with same first element
edges_diff_s = [(e1, e2) for i, e1 in enumerate(edges_tuples) for j, e2 in enumerate(edges_tuples) if i < j and e1[0] != e2[0]]

# Exclude pairs with same second element
edges_diff_t = [(e1, e2) for i, e1 in enumerate(edges_diff_s) for j, e2 in enumerate(edges_diff_s) if i < j and e1[1] != e2[1]]

# Consider every pair of edges left and write down s1, t1, s2, t2
s1_t1_s2_t2 = []
for i, (e1, e2) in enumerate(edges_diff_t):
    s1 = A.index(e1[0])
    t1 = B.index(e1[1])
    s2 = A.index(e2[0])
    t2 = B.index(e2[1])
    s1_t1_s2_t2.append(f"Pair {i+1} => s1 = {s1}, t1 = {t1}, s2 = {s2}, t2 = {t2}")

# Exclude pairs with s1 > s2 and t1 < t2
s1t1_s2t2_diff = [(p1, p2) for i, p1 in enumerate(s1_t1_s2_t2) for j, p2 in enumerate(s1_t1_s2_t2) if i < j and (p1[6] < p2[6] and p1[14] > p2[14])]

# Exclude pairs with s1 < s2 and t1 > t2
final_pairs = [(p1, p2) for p1, p2 in s1t1_s2t2_diff if not (p1[6] > p2[6] and p1[14] < p2[14])]

# Write the number of edges left
num_edges = len(final_pairs)
print(num_edges)
Since we only had one edge, the answer is 0.
