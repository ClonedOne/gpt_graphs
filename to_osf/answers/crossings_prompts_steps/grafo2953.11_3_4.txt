Based on the given arrays and list of edges, we have a bipartite graph with two disjoint sets of vertices, A and B. The vertices in set A are [6, 7], and the vertices in set B are [2, 3]. The edges in the graph are [(6, 2), (6, 3)].

Since there is only one edge, the answer is 0.

If there were more than one edge, we would need to compute the number of edge crossings in the graph. Edge crossing is defined as a pair of edges (e1, e2) such that e1 connects a vertex in A to a vertex in B, and e2 connects a different vertex in A to a different vertex in B, and the two edges cross each other in the plane.

To count the number of edge crossings, we would first exclude all pairs of edges that have the same first element or the same second element. In this case, there is only one pair of edges, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Next, we would compute s1, t1, s2, and t2 for every pair of edges, where s1 is the index of the first element of the first edge in array A, t1 is the index of the second element of the first edge in array B, s2 is the index of the first element of the second edge in array A, and t2 is the index of the second element of the second edge in array B.

For the given pair of edges [(6, 2), (6, 3)], we have s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, and t2 = 1.

We would then exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, as well as pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. In this case, there is only one pair of edges, and it satisfies neither condition, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Finally, we would count the number of remaining pairs of edges. In this case, there is only one pair of edges left, so the answer is 0.
