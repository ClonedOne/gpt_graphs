Using the given arrays and list of edges, we can represent the bipartite graph as follows:

  A   B
  |   |
 [0] [8]
  |   |
  |   |
 [0] [5]
  |   |
We can see that there are two edges in the graph. Since there are only two edges, we can stop here and write 0, as instructed.

If there were more than two edges, we would need to count the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph. We can do this using the following steps:

Exclude pairs with the same first element:
There are no pairs with the same first element in this case, so we don't need to exclude any.

Exclude pairs with the same second element:
There are no pairs with the same second element in this case, so we don't need to exclude any.

For each pair of edges left, find s1, t1, s2, and t2:
There is only one pair of edges left in this case: (0, 8) and (0, 5). We can represent this pair as follows:

Pair 1: s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 0
Exclude pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
There are no pairs to exclude based on this condition.

Exclude pairs where s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
There are no pairs to exclude based on this condition.

Therefore, the number of edges left after these steps is 2, which is the same as the original number of edges. However, since we were instructed to stop and write 0 in the case of a single edge, we can still conclude that the final answer is 0.
