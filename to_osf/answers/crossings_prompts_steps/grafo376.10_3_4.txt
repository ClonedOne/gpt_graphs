Based on the given arrays and edges, we can create the following bipartite graph:

lua
Copy code
7 -- 2
  \-- 3
Since there are only two edges in this graph, we can stop here and return 0 as the answer, as per the instructions.

If we had more than one edge, we would proceed as follows:

Exclude pairs with the same first element:
There are no such pairs in this example.
Exclude pairs with the same second element:
There are no such pairs in this example.
For every pair of remaining edges, consider the indices of their elements:
(7,2) and (7,3): s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1
Exclude pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
(7,2) and (7,3) satisfy this condition, so we exclude this pair.
Exclude pairs where s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
There are no such pairs in this example.
Since we only had one pair of edges, and we excluded it in step 4, we are left with 0 edges. Therefore, the answer is 0.
