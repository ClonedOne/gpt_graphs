The given graph has a bipartite structure with two sets of nodes: A and B. The set A has elements [9, 10] and set B has [5]. The only edge in the graph connects the node 10 from set A to the node 5 in set B.

Since there is only one edge, we can stop here and report that the number of edge crossings in the graph is 0.

If there were more than one edge, we would need to continue as follows:

Exclude pairs of edges with the same first element:

There is only one edge, so no pairs to exclude.

Exclude pairs of edges with the same second element:

There is only one edge, so no pairs to exclude.

For each pair of edges left, consider the first edge and the second edge, and write down their indices s1, t1, s2, and t2:

There is only one edge, so no pairs to consider.

Exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:

There is only one edge, so no pairs to exclude.

Exclude pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

There is only one edge, so no pairs to exclude.

Therefore, the final number of edge crossings in the graph is 0.
