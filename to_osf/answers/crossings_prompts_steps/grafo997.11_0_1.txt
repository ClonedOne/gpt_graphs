First, we need to construct the bipartite graph using the arrays and edges given:

yaml
Copy code
A: [0]
B: [7, 5, 8]

Edges:
(0, 7)
(0, 5)
(0, 8)

Bipartite graph:
0 -> 7, 5, 8
Since array A has length 1, we can stop here and write 0.

If we had more than one element in A and B, we would continue with the following steps:

Exclude all pairs of edges that have the same first element:
css
Copy code
[(0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 8)]
Exclude all pairs of edges that have the same second element:
css
Copy code
[(0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 8)]
For every remaining pair of edges, write down the indices of their elements in A and B:
makefile
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 5):
s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2

(0, 7), (0, 8):
s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 0

(0, 5), (0, 8):
s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 0
Exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
makefile
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 5):
s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2

(0, 5), (0, 8):
s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 0
Exclude all pairs of edges for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
scss
Copy code
(0, 7), (0, 5):
s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2
So we are left with a single pair of edges. Therefore, the final answer is 0.
