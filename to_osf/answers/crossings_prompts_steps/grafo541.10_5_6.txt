Based on the given arrays and list of edges, we have only one edge (6, 1) and therefore the answer is 0.

Note that since there is only one edge, there is no need to consider any pairs or do any further calculations. Additionally, since array A has only one element, there can be no other edges that cross it, and therefore the number of edge crossings is 0.
