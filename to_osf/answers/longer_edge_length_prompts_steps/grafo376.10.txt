For each edge, we can look at the layers of its source and target nodes according to the provided layer mapping. The layers are:

(0, 1): node 0 is in layer 0, and node 6 is in layer 5.
(1, 5): node 2 is in layer 1, and node 7 is in layer 4.
(1, 4): node 3 is in layer 1, and node 7 is in layer 4.
(1, 3): node 3 is in layer 1, and node 8 is in layer 3.
(3, 4): node 8 is in layer 3, and node 4 is in layer 4.
(1, 2): node 3 is in layer 1, and node 9 is in layer 2.
(2, 3): node 5 is in layer 2, and node 9 is in layer 3.
(2, 3): node 5 is in layer 2, and node 9 is in layer 3).
We can now calculate the length of each edge, using the given formula. The lengths are:

(0, 6): |5-0| = 5
(2, 7): |4-1| = 3
(3, 7): |4-1| = 3
(3, 8): |3-1| = 2
(8, 4): |4-3| = 1
(3, 9): |2-1| = 1
(5, 9): |3-2| = 1
(5, 9): |3-2| = 1
The total sum of the lengths is the sum of the individual lengths, which is:

5 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

So the final sum is 17.

Answer:

Edge and length:
(0, 6) -> 5
(2, 7) -> 3
(3, 7) -> 3
(3, 8) -> 2
(8, 4) -> 1
(3, 9) -> 1
(5, 9) -> 1
(5, 9) -> 1

Total sum of lengths: 17
