The total sum of the edge lengths is 13.

Explanation:

(5, 2) has edge length 2 - 1 = 1
(6, 1) has edge length 3 - 1 = 2
(3, 6) has edge length 2 - 1 = 1
(0, 1) has edge length 1 - 0 = 1
(4, 2) has edge length 2 - 1 = 1
(7, 2) has edge length 2 - 1 = 1
(1, 8) has edge length 5 - 3 = 2
(6, 8) has edge length 5 - 3 = 2
(1, 2) has edge length 4 - 3 = 1
(1, 9) has edge length 5 - 3 = 2
(5, 9) has edge length 5 - 2 = 3
(5, 10) has edge length 5 - 2 = 3
(7, 10) has edge length 5 - 2 = 3
Total sum: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13
