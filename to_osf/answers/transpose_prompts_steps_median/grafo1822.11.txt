First, listing every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer, along with their indices and median:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 3]
Index of 1: 0
Index of 3: 1
Median of neighbors of 0: 0.5

Next, listing the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
1 -> 0
3 -> 1

Layer 2:
2 -> 0
7 -> 1
6 -> 2
4 -> 3
8 -> 4

Layer 3:
9 -> 0
10 -> 1
5 -> 2

Finally, listing the nodes in the layers, sorted according to their associated median value:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [1, 3]
Layer 2: [2, 7, 6, 4, 8]
Layer 3: [9, 10, 5]
