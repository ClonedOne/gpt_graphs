Listing neighbors of nodes in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: []

Index of neighbors in layer 1:

Median of indices: 0

Listing nodes and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
3 -> 0

Layer 2:
2 -> 0
4 -> 1
9 -> 2

Layer 3:
8 -> 0
5 -> 1
1 -> 2
6 -> 3

Layer 4:
7 -> 1

Listing sorted nodes in each layer based on their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [3]
Layer 2: [2, 4, 9]
Layer 3: [8, 5, 1, 6]
Layer 4: [7]
