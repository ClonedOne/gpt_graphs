Listing neighbors of Layer 0 nodes:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [5, 8]
Index of 5: 0
Index of 8: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Listing nodes and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
5 -> 0
8 -> 1
1 -> 2
10 -> 2.5
4 -> 2
9 -> 2.5

Layer 2:
6 -> 0
2 -> 1
7 -> 2
3 -> 3

Listing sorted nodes in each layer by their associated median:

Layer 0: [0]

Layer 1: [5, 8, 1, 4, 9, 10]

Layer 2: [6, 2, 7, 3]
