First, listing the neighbors of nodes in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 3, 10]
Index of 1: 0
Index of 3: 1
Index of 10: 2
Median of indices: 1

Now, listing nodes and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 1

Layer 1:
1 -> 0
3 -> 1
10 -> 2

Layer 2:
2 -> 0.5
4 -> 2
5 -> 3
6 -> 0.5
7 -> 3.5
8 -> 2.5
9 -> 3

Finally, sorting nodes in each layer based on their associated median value:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [1, 3, 10]
Layer 2: [2, 6, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5]
