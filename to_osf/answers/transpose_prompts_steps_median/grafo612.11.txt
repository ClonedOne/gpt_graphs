First, let's list the neighbors of each node in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 10]
Index of 1: 0
Index of 10: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Now we can move on to the next layer and repeat the process until we reach the last layer:
Layer 1: [1, 10]
Neighbors of 1: [6, 7]
Index of 6: 0
Index of 7: 1
Median of indices: 0.5
Neighbors of 10: [6, 4]
Index of 6: 0
Index of 4: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Layer 2: [6, 7, 4]
Neighbors of 6: []
Median of indices: 0
Neighbors of 7: [2, 3]
Index of 2: 0
Index of 3: 1
Median of indices: 0.5
Neighbors of 4: [8]
Index of 8: 0
Median of indices: 0

Layer 3: [2, 3, 8]
Neighbors of 2: []
Median of indices: 0
Neighbors of 3: [9]
Index of 9: 0
Median of indices: 0
Neighbors of 8: []
Median of indices: 0

Layer 4: [9]
Neighbors of 9: [5]
Index of 5: 0
Median of indices: 0

Layer 5: [5]
Neighbors of 5: []
Median of indices: 0

Now let's list the nodes in each layer with their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
1 -> 0.5
10 -> 0.5

Layer 2:
6 -> 0
7 -> 0.5
4 -> 0

Layer 3:
2 -> 0
3 -> 0
8 -> 0

Layer 4:
9 -> 0

Layer 5:
5 -> 0

Finally, let's list the layers with the nodes in them, sorted by their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [1, 10]
Layer 2: [6, 4, 7]
Layer 3: [2, 3, 8]
Layer 4: [9]
Layer 5: [5]
