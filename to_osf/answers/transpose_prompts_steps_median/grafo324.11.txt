First, let's list the neighbors of nodes in layer 0 and their indices in the next layer:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [5]
Index of 5: 0

Now, let's list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
5 -> 0

Layer 2:
1 -> 0
9 -> 0

Layer 3:
10 -> 0

Layer 4:
2 -> 1.5

Layer 5:
6 -> 0
8 -> 1

Layer 6:
3 -> 0
7 -> 1

Layer 7:
4 -> 0

Next, let's write the layers and the nodes in them, sorted according to their associated median values:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [5]
Layer 2: [1, 9]
Layer 3: [10]
Layer 4: [2]
Layer 5: [6, 8]
Layer 6: [3, 7]
Layer 7: [4]
