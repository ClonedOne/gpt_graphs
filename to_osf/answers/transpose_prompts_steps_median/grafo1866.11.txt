Listing the nodes and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 2.5

Layer 1:
1 -> 0.0
6 -> 0.0
5 -> 0.5
3 -> 0.5
7 -> 0.0
8 -> 0.0

Layer 2:
9 -> 0
10 -> 0
4 -> 0
2 -> 0

Sorting the nodes in each layer based on their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [5, 3, 1, 6, 7, 8]
Layer 2: [9, 10, 4, 2]
