First, listing the neighbors of the nodes in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: []

Moving on to layer 1:
Layer 1: [7]
Neighbors of 7: [1, 2]

Their indices in layer 2 are:
Index of 1: 0
Index of 2: 1
Median: 0.5

Moving on to layer 2:
Layer 2: [1, 2]
Neighbors of 1: []
Neighbors of 2: [6, 5, 9]

Their indices in layer 3 are:
Index of 6: 0
Index of 5: 1
Index of 9: 2
Median: 1

Moving on to layer 3:
Layer 3: [6, 5, 9]
Neighbors of 6: []
Neighbors of 5: [3, 10]
Neighbors of 9: [8]

Their indices in layer 4 are:
Index of 3: 0
Index of 10: 1
Index of 8: 0
Median: 0

Moving on to layer 4:
Layer 4: [3, 10, 8]
Neighbors of 3: []
Neighbors of 10: []
Neighbors of 8: [4]

Their index in layer 5 is:
Index of 4: 0
Median: 0

Moving on to layer 5:
Layer 5: [4]
Neighbors of 4: []

We can now list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
7 -> 0.5

Layer 2:
1 -> 0
2 -> 1

Layer 3:
6 -> 0
5 -> 1
9 -> 2

Layer 4:
3 -> 0
10 -> 0
8 -> 0

Layer 5:
4 -> 0

Finally, we can sort the nodes in each layer according to their associated median value:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [7]
Layer 2: [1, 2]
Layer 3: [6, 5, 9]
Layer 4: [3, 8, 10]
Layer 5: [4]
