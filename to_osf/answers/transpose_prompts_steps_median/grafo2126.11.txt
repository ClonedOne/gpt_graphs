First step: list every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 3]

Index of 1: 0
Index of 3: 1

Median of indices: 0.5

Layer 1: [1, 3]
Neighbors of 1: [2, 5, 4, 9, 10]
Neighbors of 3: [2, 4, 10]

Index of 2: 0
Index of 5: 1
Index of 4: 2
Index of 9: 3
Index of 10: 4

Median of indices: 2

Layer 2: [2, 5, 4, 9, 10]
Neighbors of 2: [8]
Neighbors of 5: []
Neighbors of 4: [7, 8]
Neighbors of 9: [6]
Neighbors of 10: [7]

Index of 8: 0
Index of 7: 1
Index of 6: 2

Median of indices: 1

Layer 3: [8, 7, 6]
Neighbors of 8: []
Neighbors of 7: []
Neighbors of 6: []

Index of NaN: 0

Median of indices: 0

Second step: list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians

Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
1 -> 2
3 -> 2

Layer 2:
2 -> 1
5 -> 0
4 -> 1
9 -> 2
10 -> 2

Layer 3:
8 -> 0
7 -> 0
6 -> 0

Third step: list the nodes in the layers sorted according to their associated median value

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [1, 3]
Layer 2: [5, 2, 4, 9, 10]
Layer 3: [6, 7, 8]
