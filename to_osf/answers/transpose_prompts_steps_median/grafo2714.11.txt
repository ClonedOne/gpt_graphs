First, let's list the neighbors of each node in layer 0 and their indices in layer 1:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [5]
Index of 5: 0
Median of indices: 0

Now, let's list the nodes in each layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
5 -> 0

Layer 2:
1 -> 0
4 -> 0
7 -> 0

Layer 3:
6 -> 1
8 -> 1
9 -> 1

Layer 4:
2 -> 3
3 -> 3
10 -> 3

Finally, let's sort the nodes in each layer based on their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [5]
Layer 2: [1, 4, 7]
Layer 3: [6, 8, 9]
Layer 4: [2, 3, 10]
