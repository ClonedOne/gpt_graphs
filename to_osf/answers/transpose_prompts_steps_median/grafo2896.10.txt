Starting from layer 0, the neighbors of the nodes in layer 0 are:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [8, 5]

Index of 8: 0
Index of 5: 1

Median of indices: 0.5

So the associated median for node 0 is 0.5.

Moving on to the next layer, we have:

Layer 1: [8, 5]
Neighbors of 8: [3]
Neighbors of 5: [1]

Index of 3: 0
Index of 1: 1

Median of indices for layer 1: 0.5

So the associated median for nodes 8 and 5 is 0.5.

Continuing with the next layer:

Layer 2: [3, 1]
Neighbors of 3: [6, 4]
Neighbors of 1: [7]

Index of 6: 0
Index of 4: 1
Index of 7: 2

Median of indices for layer 2: 1

So the associated medians for nodes 3 and 1 are 1.

Next layer:

Layer 3: [6, 4, 7]
Neighbors of 6: []
Neighbors of 4: [9]
Neighbors of 7: []

Index of 9: 1

Median of indices for layer 3: 1

So the associated medians for nodes 6, 4, and 7 are 1.

And the final layers:

Layer 4: [9]
Neighbors of 9: [2]

Index of 2: 0

Median of indices for layer 4: 0

So the associated median for node 9 is 0.

Layer 5: [2]
Neighbors of 2: []

Median of indices for layer 5: 0

So the associated median for node 2 is 0.

Sorted layers:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [8, 5]
Layer 2: [3, 1]
Layer 3: [4, 6, 7]
Layer 4: [9]
Layer 5: [2]
