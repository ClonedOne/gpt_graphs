First, let's list every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [9]

Index of 9: 0

Layer 1: [9]
Neighbors of 9: [2, 3, 8, 6, 7, 0]
Index of 2: 0
Index of 3: 1
Index of 8: 2
Index of 6: 3
Index of 7: 4
Index of 0: 5

Median indices: 2

Layer 2: [2, 3, 8, 6, 7]
Neighbors of 2: [5]
Index of 5: 0

Median indices: 0

Neighbors of 3: [1]
Index of 1: 0

Median indices: 0

Neighbors of 8: []

Median indices: 0

Neighbors of 6: [1]
Index of 1: 0

Median indices: 0

Neighbors of 7: []

Median indices: 0

Layer 3: [5, 1]
Neighbors of 5: []

Median indices: 0

Neighbors of 1: [4]
Index of 4: 0

Median indices: 0

Layer 4: [4]
Neighbors of 4: []

Median indices: 0

Next, let's list the nodes in each layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 2.0

Layer 1:
9 -> 0.0

Median of layer 1: 0.0

Layer 2:
2 -> 0.0
3 -> 0.0
8 -> 0.0
6 -> 0.0
7 -> 0.0

Median of layer 2: 0.0

Layer 3:
5 -> 0.0
1 -> 0.0

Median of layer 3: 0.0

Layer 4:
4 -> 0.0

Median of layer 4: 0.0

Finally, let's list the nodes in each layer sorted by their associated median:

Layer 0:
[0]

Layer 1:
[9]

Layer 2:
[2, 3, 6, 7, 8]

Layer 3:
[1, 5]

Layer 4:
[4]
