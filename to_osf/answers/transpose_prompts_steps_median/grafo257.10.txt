First, listing neighbors of nodes in layer 0 and their indices in the next layer:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [5, 7]
Index of 5: 0
Index of 7: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Now, listing nodes in every layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5
Layer 1:
5 -> 0
7 -> 1
Layer 2:
2 -> 3.5
Layer 3:
6 -> 0
8 -> 1
Layer 4:
1 -> 4.5
3 -> 8.5
Layer 5:
9 -> 4
Layer 6:
4 -> 0

Sorting nodes in every layer according to their associated median:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [5, 7]
Layer 2: [2]
Layer 3: [8, 6]
Layer 4: [1, 3]
Layer 5: [9]
Layer 6: [4]
