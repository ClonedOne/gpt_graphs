Graph G has 11 nodes, numbered from 0 to 10. Graph G has 22 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[0, 1],[1, 2],[2, 3],[0, 3],[4, 5],[6, 7],[1, 6],[4, 1],[4, 3],[1, 8],[8, 9],[9, 1],[2, 9],[7, 2],[10, 7],[10, 4],[10, 5],[10, 0],[10, 2],[10, 1],[10, 6],[10, 8]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
