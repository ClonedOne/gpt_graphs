The following is the description of a layered graph. 
A layered graph is a graph where each node is contained in a single layer.
The following is the list of directed edges, formatted as [(<source_id>, <target_id>)].

edge_list: [(0, 5), (5, 1), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 8), (0, 8), (7, 1), (3, 9), (2, 9), (3, 10)]

The second is a mapping of layers to the nodes contained within. Every array is a different layer, and the numbers in every array indicate the nodes in that layer.

Layer 0: [0] 
Layer 1: [3, 7] 
Layer 2: [2, 5] 
Layer 3: [4, 8, 10] 
Layer 4: [1, 9] 
Layer 5: [6] 

Count the total edge length. Edge length is equal to the length of each edge, where the distance between two layers is always 1.

Write no explanations and no code, just return the total edge length as an integer, with no other words.
