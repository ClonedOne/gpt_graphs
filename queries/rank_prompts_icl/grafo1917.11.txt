Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1. 
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
