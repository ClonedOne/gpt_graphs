Graph G has 11 nodes, numbered from 0 to 10. Graph G has 17 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[0, 1],[0, 2],[4, 5],[6, 1],[1, 5],[7, 1],[8, 3],[8, 4],[8, 7],[8, 0],[8, 2],[2, 7],[3, 4],[3, 9],[9, 2],[10, 9],[10, 8]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
