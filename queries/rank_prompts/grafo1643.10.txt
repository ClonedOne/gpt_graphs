Graph G has 10 nodes, numbered from 0 to 9. Graph G has 9 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[0, 1],[2, 3],[3, 4],[4, 5],[7, 2],[6, 8],[8, 7],[9, 4],[4, 0]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
