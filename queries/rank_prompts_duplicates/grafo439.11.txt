Graph G has 11 nodes, numbered from 0 to 10. Graph G has 14 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[0, 4],[4, 1],[1, 6],[0, 5],[5, 2],[7, 1],[8, 2],[4, 2],[3, 9],[9, 0],[10, 9],[10, 1],[10, 7],[10, 0]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
