Graph G has 10 nodes, numbered from 0 to 9. Graph G has 12 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[2, 6],[6, 3],[7, 0],[8, 6],[8, 1],[5, 6],[1, 3],[7, 4],[9, 4],[9, 6],[9, 1],[5, 2]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
