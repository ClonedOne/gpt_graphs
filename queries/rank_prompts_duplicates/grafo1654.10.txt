Graph G has 10 nodes, numbered from 0 to 9. Graph G has 14 edges.
This is the list of edge connections:
[0, 1],[1, 2],[2, 3],[0, 3],[5, 6],[6, 1],[1, 5],[4, 1],[4, 3],[1, 7],[0, 6],[8, 1],[9, 2],[5, 2]
Perform a rank assignment on the graph. Use node 0 as a source for the graph. Each node must be assigned to a rank that is equal to the shortest path between that node and the source. Thus, node 0 will be assigned to rank 0, and the neighbors of node 0 will be assigned to rank 1.
Write no explanations, only respond with the id of each node and the rank it has been assigned to in a format <id> - <rank>.
