Given the following arrays: 
A: [1, 4, 7]
B: [6, 8, 9]

And the following list of tuples:
Tuples: [(1, 6), (4, 8), (7, 9)]

Where for each tuple the first element of comes from array A, and the second element comes from array B.

Assuming this is a bipartite graph, count the edge crossings. Two edges that share a source or a target can not cross. Two edges cross if the order of their sources is opposite to the order of their targets.

Exclude all edge crossings where edges have the same source or the same target.

Write no explanations and no code. Return the pairs of edges that cross, one per line.
