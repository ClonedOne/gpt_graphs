A layered graph is a graph where each node is contained in a single layer.
A layered graph is described by list of directed edges, formatted as [(<source_id>, <target_id>)], and a mapping of layers to the nodes contained within.
Every array in the mapping is a different layer, and the numbers in every array indicate the nodes in that layer.

Count the total edge length. 
The edge length of each edge e is always equal to the absolute value of the number of the layer the target is contained in, minus the number of the layer the source is contained in.
The edge length can't be negative.

Write no explanations and no code. Return the total sum of the lengths.

## Input:
List of edges formatted as [<source_id>, <target_id>]:
edges = [(4, 2), (2, 5), (1, 5), (6, 1), (0, 7), (3, 8), (1, 2), (6, 9), (0, 9), (10, 5)]
Mapping of layers to nodes:
ranks = Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [3, 4, 6, 7, 10]
Layer 2: [8, 9]
Layer 3: [1]
Layer 4: [2]
Layer 5: [5]
