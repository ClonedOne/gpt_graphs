This is a list of directed edges in a layered graph.
[(0, 6), (6, 1), (1, 7), (7, 2), (7, 3), (3, 8), (8, 4), (3, 9), (9, 5)]

This is the description of what nodes are contained in what layer:  Layer 0: [0] 
Layer 1: [6] 
Layer 2: [1] 
Layer 3: [7] 
Layer 4: [2, 3] 
Layer 5: [8, 9] 
Layer 6: [4, 5] 

Start from layer 0. 
List every node in layer 0, and for each node list its neighbors in the next layer. 
Like this: 
Layer 0: [<node1>, <node2>, ...]
Neighbors of <node1>: [<neighbor1>, <neighbor2>, ...]

Then, for every one of the neighbors, write their index in their layer. So if node 6 belongs to layer 2 and is in the fourth position in layer 2, its index is 3.
Like this:
Index of <neighbor1>: <value>
And under each set of indices write the median of the indices.

Now I want you to start again from layer 0, and this time I want you to list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians.
Like this:
Layer 0:
<node 0> -> <median of the neighbors of node 0>

If a number is NaN, then it is equal to 0.
If a node has no neighbors, assign an associated median of 0.

Finally, I want you to write the layers and the nodes in them once more, but the nodes in the layers have to be sorted according to their associated median value. 
Like this:
Layer 0: [<sorted nodes in layer 0>]
If node A has an associated median value that is less than the associated median value of node B, then node A must come before node B. 
This time, write no additional information other than the layers and the sorted nodes.
