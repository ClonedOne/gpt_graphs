You are a powerful algorithm for graph drawing. Your job is to answer questions regarding graphs. This is a list of directed edges in a graph::

edge_list: [(3, 9), (9, 0), (0, 4), (4, 1), (1, 6), (6, 3), (1, 5), (5, 2), (1, 7), (8, 1), (10, 2), (4, 2)]

Start from node 0. Node 0 belongs to layer 0.

Find all the neighbors of node 0. Assign all the neighbors of node 0 to layer number 1.
Then write the list of nodes belonging to layer 1 in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.

Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 2. 
Then write the list of nodes belonging to layer 2, in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.

Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 3. 
Then write the list of nodes belonging to layer 3 in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.

Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 4. 
Then write the list of nodes belonging to layer 4 in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.

Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 5. 
Then write the list of nodes belonging to layer 5 in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.

Repeat the process, incrementing the layer, until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer
Write the final result in a code block, one node per line, formatted as node: layer.
