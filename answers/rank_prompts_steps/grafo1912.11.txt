Starting from node 0, the initial layer is 0.

Neighbors of node 0 are 1 and 3. They belong to layer 1.
makefile
Copy code
1: 1
3: 1
Neighbors of nodes 1 and 3 that do not already belong to a layer are 2 and 6. They belong to layer 2.
makefile
Copy code
2: 2
6: 2
Neighbors of nodes 2 and 6 that do not already belong to a layer are 8 and 9. Node 5 also belongs to layer 3, as it is a neighbor of node 2.
makefile
Copy code
8: 3
9: 3
5: 3
Neighbors of nodes 8, 9, and 5 that do not already belong to a layer are 10 and 7. Node 4 also belongs to layer 4, as it is a neighbor of node 3.
makefile
Copy code
10: 4
7: 4
4: 4
The only node that has not been assigned to a layer yet is node 11, which is a neighbor of node 10. It belongs to layer 5.
makefile
Copy code
11: 5
Thus, the final result is:

makefile

0: 0
1: 1
