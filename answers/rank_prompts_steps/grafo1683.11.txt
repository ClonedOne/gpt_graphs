Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Start from node 0, and assign it to layer 0.
Find all neighbors of node 0, which are nodes 9 and 3. Assign them to layer 1.
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 10, 5, and 1. Assign them to layer 2.
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 2, 8, and 6. Assign them to layer 3.
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 7 and 4. Assign them to layer 4.
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. This is node 5. Assign it to layer 5.
No more nodes can be added to the graph, so we stop here.
Here's the final list of nodes and their corresponding layers:
