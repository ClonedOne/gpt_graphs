Starting from node 0, the neighbors are nodes 6 and 7. We assign these nodes to layer 1.

Next, we find the neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8 are such neighbors, and we assign them to layer 2.

Next, we find the neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. Nodes 4 and 9 are such neighbors, and we assign them to layer 3.

Next, we find the neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. Node 5 is such a neighbor, and we assign it to layer 4.

Finally, we find the neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. Node 10 is such a neighbor, and we assign it to layer 5.

At this point, there are no more nodes that are not assigned to a layer, so we have completed the process.

Here is the final result, with each node and its corresponding layer shown in a code block, one node per line:
