Starting from node 0 with layer 0, we can perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to assign layers to all nodes in the graph.

First, we add node 0 to layer 0 and find its neighbors: 6.
We add 6 to layer 1 and find its neighbors: 1.
We add 1 to layer 2 and find its neighbors: None.
We move to the next node in layer 1, which is 6. Its neighbors are: None.
We move to the next node in layer 2, which is 1. Its neighbors are: None.
At this point, all nodes have been assigned to a layer. The resulting layer assignment is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
6: 1
1: 2
3: 3
10: 3
7: 4
4: 4
8: 4
2: 4
5: 5
9: 6
Note that the order in which the nodes were assigned to layers may differ depending on the implementation of the BFS algorithm.

To answer the remaining questions:

Find all neighbors of node 0. Assign all the neighbors of node 0 to layer number 1.
makefile
Copy code
6: 1
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 2.
makefile
Copy code
1: 2
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 3.
Copy code
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 4.
makefile
Copy code
7: 4
4: 4
8: 4
10: 4
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 5.
makefile
Copy code
2: 5
Repeat the process, incrementing the layer, until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer
Since there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer, we have completed the BFS and the resulting layer assignment is the same as above.
