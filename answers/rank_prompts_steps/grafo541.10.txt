Starting from node 0, we can perform a breadth-first search to assign a layer number to each node in the graph. Here's the algorithm step by step:

Assign node 0 to layer 0
Find all neighbors of node 0: nodes 5. Assign them to layer 1.
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer: nodes 3, 6. Assign them to layer 2.
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer: nodes 1, 2, 7. Assign them to layer 3.
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer: nodes 4, 8, 9. Assign them to layer 4.
Now all nodes have been assigned to a layer, so we can write the final result:
