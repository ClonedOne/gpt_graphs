Starting from node 0, we can construct the graph using the given edge list as follows:

rust
Copy code
0 -> 1
1 -> 6, 7, 9
2 -> 3, 8
3 -> 
4 -> 1, 3, 5, 8, 10
5 -> 6
6 -> 
7 -> 8
8 -> 1, 2
9 -> 2
10 -> 4, 6
Using this graph, we can perform breadth-first search starting from node 0 to find the layers of each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

Node 0 belongs to layer 0.
The neighbors of node 0 are nodes 1 and 3. Assign them to layer 1.
makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
3: 1
The neighbors of nodes 1 and 3 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 6, 7, 9, and 2. Assign them to layer 2.
makefile
Copy code
2: 2
6: 2
7: 2
9: 2
The neighbors of nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 8 and 3. Assign them to layer 3.
makefile
Copy code
3: 3
8: 3
The neighbors of nodes 8 and 3 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 1, 4, and 2. Assign them to layer 4.
makefile
Copy code
1: 4
2: 4
4: 4
The neighbors of nodes 1, 2, and 4 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 5, 10, and 6. Assign them to layer 5.
makefile
Copy code
5: 5
6: 5
10: 5
The neighbors of nodes 5, 6, and 10 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 4 and 1. Assign them to layer 6.
makefile
Copy code
4: 6
At this point, all nodes have been assigned to a layer. Here's the final result:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 4
2: 4
3: 3
4: 6
5: 5
6: 5
7: 2
8: 3
9: 2
10: 5
