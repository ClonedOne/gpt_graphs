Starting from node 0, we can perform a Breadth First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and assign a depth level to each node. We start with layer 0 at node 0, then find its neighbors and assign them to layer 1, then find their neighbors and assign them to layer 2, and so on.

Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Start from node 0 with layer 0
Step 2: Find all neighbors of node 0, which are nodes 1 and 6. Assign them to layer 1.
Step 3: Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 9, 8, and 1. Assign them to layer 2.
Step 4: Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 5, 3, and 6. Assign them to layer 3.
Step 5: Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. These are nodes 2, 10, and 7. Assign them to layer 4.
Step 6: Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. There are no more nodes to assign.
Therefore, the final result is:
