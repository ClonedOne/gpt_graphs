Starting from node 0 with layer 0, we can follow the steps below to determine the layers of all nodes in the graph:

Find all neighbors of node 0 and assign them to layer 1:
makefile
Copy code
1: 1
5: 1
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer and assign them to layer 2:
makefile
Copy code
9: 2
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer and assign them to layer 3:
makefile
Copy code
2: 3
1: 3
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer and assign them to layer 4:
makefile
Copy code
10: 4
8: 4
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer and assign them to layer 5:
makefile
Copy code
3: 5
7: 5
There are no nodes left that are not already assigned to a layer, so the final result is:
makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 3
2: 3
3: 5
4: 6
5: 1
6: 7
7: 5
8: 4
9: 2
10: 4
