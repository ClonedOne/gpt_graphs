Starting from node 0, the graph can be visualized as follows:

rust
Copy code
0 -> 5
3 -> 7, 8, 0
6 -> 9
9 -> 3
2 -> 7
7 -> 1
8 -> 4
Using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, we can find all the nodes at a certain distance from node 0. We start by assigning layer 0 to node 0, and then proceed as follows:

Find all the neighbors of the nodes in the current layer that do not already belong to a layer.
Assign the neighbors found to a new layer.
Repeat the above steps until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer.
Applying this algorithm to the given graph, we get:

makefile
Copy code
# Start from layer 0
0: 0

# Neighbors of 0 are 5
5: 1

# Neighbors of 5 are none

# Neighbors of 0 are 5 and 3
3: 1
7: 1

# Neighbors of 7 are 1
1: 2

# Neighbors of 3 are 7, 8, 0 and 9
8: 2
0: 2
9: 2

# Neighbors of 8 are 4
4: 3

# Neighbors of 9 are 3 and 6
6: 3

# Neighbors of 1 are none
# Neighbors of 4 are none
# Neighbors of 6 are none

# Neighbors of 2 are 7
Therefore, the final result is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
3: 1
7: 1
1: 2
8: 2
0: 2
9: 2
4: 3
6: 3
2: 4
