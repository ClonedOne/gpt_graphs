Starting from node 0, we can use Breadth First Search to traverse the graph and assign each node a layer number based on its distance from node 0. Here's how we can do it step by step:

We start with node 0 in layer 0.

We find all the neighbors of node 0, which are 6. We assign node 6 to layer 1.

We find all the neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer, which are 1. We assign node 1 to layer 2.

We find all the neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer, which are 7. We assign node 7 to layer 3.

We find all the neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer, which are 2, 3. We assign nodes 2 and 3 to layer 4.

We find all the neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer, which are 8, 9. We assign nodes 8 and 9 to layer 5.

We find all the neighbors of the nodes in layer 5 that do not already belong to a layer, which are 4, 5. We assign nodes 4 and 5 to layer 6.

There are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer, so the final result is:

0: 0
6: 1
1: 2
7: 3
2: 4
3: 4
8: 5
9: 5
4: 6
5: 6
Note that there can be multiple valid layer assignments for a given graph, depending on the starting node and the order in which we visit the nodes. However, for acyclic graphs like this one, the resulting layering is unique up to a permutation of the nodes within each layer.
