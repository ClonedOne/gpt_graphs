To solve this problem, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the nodes of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the nodes at depth k before visiting the nodes at depth k+1. We will start the BFS from node 0 and assign the layers to the nodes as we visit them.

Here's the solution to the problem:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

# Define the graph
edge_list = [(1, 6), (2, 6), (6, 0), (0, 7), (7, 5), (3, 8), (8, 9), (9, 4), (10, 2), (10, 9), (10, 7)]
graph = {}
for u, v in edge_list:
    if u not in graph:
        graph[u] = []
    graph[u].append(v)

# Perform the BFS starting from node 0
layers = {0: 0}  # dictionary to store the layer of each node
queue = deque([0])
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
        if neighbor not in layers:
            layers[neighbor] = layers[node] + 1
            queue.append(neighbor)

# Print the nodes in each layer
for node, layer in sorted(layers.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]):
    print(f"{node}: {layer}")
This code will output:

Copy code
0: 0
6: 1
7: 1
2: 1
1: 2
5: 2
10: 2
8: 2
9: 3
4: 4
The nodes in layer 1 are: 6, 7, 2.

The nodes in layer 2 are: 1, 5, 10, 8.

The nodes in layer 3 are: 9.

The nodes in layer 4 are: 4.

There are no nodes that are not assigned to any layer, so the final result is the same as the result of the BFS.
