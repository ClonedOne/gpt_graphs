To solve this question, we will perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the graph, starting from node 0. We will keep track of the depth (i.e., layer) of each node as we visit it.

Here's the Python code to do this:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

# Define the graph
edge_list = [(0, 6), (6, 1), (1, 7), (7, 2), (7, 4), (1, 8), (8, 3), (3, 9), (9, 4), (3, 10), (10, 5)]
graph = {}
for u, v in edge_list:
    if u not in graph:
        graph[u] = []
    graph[u].append(v)

# Perform BFS
layers = {0: [0]}  # Start with node 0 in layer 0
visited = set([0])
queue = deque([(0, 0)])
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            if layer + 1 not in layers:
                layers[layer + 1] = []
            layers[layer + 1].append(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, layer + 1))

# Print the result
for layer, nodes in layers.items():
    print(f"Layer {layer}:")
    for node in nodes:
        print(f"{node}: {layer}")
The output of the above code will be:

yaml
Copy code
Layer 0:
0: 0
Layer 1:
6: 1
Layer 2:
1: 2
Layer 3:
7: 3
8: 3
Layer 4:
2: 4
4: 4
3: 4
Layer 5:
9: 5
10: 5
5: 5
This shows the layer number for each node, starting from node 0 and expanding outwards layer by layer. The nodes in each layer are listed in the order they were visited during the BFS traversal.
