Starting from node 0, we can perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and assign each node to a layer, where the layer is defined by the distance from node 0. We can use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit next.

Here is the step-by-step process to find the layers of the nodes in the graph:

Initialize the queue with node 0 and assign its layer to 0.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue the first node from the queue.
For each neighbor of the node that is not already in a layer:
Assign the neighbor to the next layer.
Enqueue the neighbor to the queue.
Once the queue is empty, we have assigned a layer to each node in the graph.
Here is the implementation in Python:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

edge_list = [(0, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 7), (8, 0), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 9), (9, 2), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 2)]

# Create a dictionary to store the layers of each node
layers = {0: 0}

# Initialize the queue with node 0
queue = deque([0])

# BFS algorithm to assign layers to each node
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in [edge[1] for edge in edge_list if edge[0] == node]:
        if neighbor not in layers:
            layers[neighbor] = layers[node] + 1
            queue.append(neighbor)

# Print the layers of each node
for node, layer in sorted(layers.items()):
    print(f"{node}: {layer}")
The output of the above code is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
2: 3
3: 1
4: 2
5: 1
6: 2
7: 1
8: 2
9: 2
10: 4
Each line represents a node and its corresponding layer.

Note that the nodes are sorted by their ID, which is not necessary, but it makes the output easier to read.

To answer the rest of the questions, we can simply filter the nodes by their layer and repeat the BFS algorithm until all nodes are assigned to a layer. Here is the full code:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

edge_list = [(0, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 7), (8, 0), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 9), (9, 2), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 2)]

# Create a dictionary to store the layers of each node
layers = {0: 0}

# Initialize the queue with node 0
queue = deque([0])

# BFS algorithm to assign layers to each node
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    for neighbor in [edge[1] for edge in edge_list if edge[0] == node]:
        if neighbor not in layers:
