Here's the solution to the problem:

python
Copy code
from collections import defaultdict

# The given edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (0, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (7, 1), (1, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (1, 8), (7, 4), (5, 9), (9, 6), (10, 9), (10, 6), (10, 5)]

# Create an adjacency list to represent the graph
adj_list = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edge_list:
    adj_list[u].append(v)

# Create a dictionary to store the layer number of each node
layer = {0: 0}

# Initialize a queue with node 0 and its layer number
queue = [(0, 0)]

# Use BFS to assign layer numbers to all nodes
while queue:
    node, curr_layer = queue.pop(0)
    for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
        if neighbor not in layer:
            layer[neighbor] = curr_layer + 1
            queue.append((neighbor, curr_layer + 1))

# Print the result
for node, node_layer in layer.items():
    print(f"{node}: {node_layer}")
Output:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
3: 1
2: 2
8: 2
4: 2
6: 2
5: 3
7: 3
9: 4
10: 5
Explanation:
We start with node 0 at layer 0. Then we find all the neighbors of node 0, which are nodes 1 and 3. We assign them layer number 1. Then we find all the neighbors of nodes 1 and 3 that do not already belong to a layer. We assign them layer number 2. We repeat the process, incrementing the layer number, until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer. The final layer numbers are printed.
