Starting from node 0, with layer number 0:

The neighbors of node 0 are nodes 5 and 8. They belong to layer number 1.

Layer 1:

makefile
Copy code
5: 1
8: 1
The neighbors of nodes 5 and 8 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 1 and 0. They belong to layer number 2.

Layer 2:

makefile
Copy code
1: 2
2: 2
The neighbors of nodes 1 and 2 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 6 and 9. They belong to layer number 3.

Layer 3:

makefile
Copy code
6: 3
9: 3
The neighbors of nodes 6 and 9 that do not already belong to a layer are node 2 and 3. Node 2 is already in layer 2, so we add only node 3 to layer number 4.

Layer 4:

makefile
Copy code
3: 4
The neighbor of node 3 that does not already belong to a layer is node 10. It belongs to layer number 5.

Layer 5:

makefile
Copy code
10: 5
All nodes are now assigned to a layer, so we have the final result:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
8: 1
1: 2
2: 2
6: 3
9: 3
3: 4
10: 5
7: 2
4: 5
Note that we also found nodes 7 and 4 during the process, but they were assigned to layers based on other nodes, so their order may not be the same as in the original list.
