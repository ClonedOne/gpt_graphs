Starting from node 0 with layer 0:

Find all the neighbors of node 0. Assign all the neighbors of node 0 to layer number 1.

Node 5: 1

Nodes in layer 1:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 2.

Node 1: 2

Nodes in layer 2:

makefile
Copy code
1: 2
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 3.

Nodes 6: 3

Nodes in layer 3:

makefile
Copy code
6: 3
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 4.

Nodes 2, 3, 7: 4

Nodes in layer 4:

makefile
Copy code
2: 4
3: 4
7: 4
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 5.

Nodes 4, 10: 5

Nodes in layer 5:

makefile
Copy code
4: 5
10: 5
Find all neighbors of the nodes in layer 5 that do not already belong to a layer. Assign to them depth 6.

Nodes 8, 9: 6

Nodes in layer 6:

makefile
Copy code
8: 6
9: 6
At this point, all nodes have been assigned to a layer. The final result is:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
5: 1
1: 2
6: 3
2: 4
3: 4
7: 4
4: 5
10: 5
8: 6
9: 6
