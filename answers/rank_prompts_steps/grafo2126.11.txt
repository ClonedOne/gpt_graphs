Starting from node 0 in layer 0:

Neighbors of node 0 are nodes 1 and 3. Assign them to layer 1.
Nodes in layer 1:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
3: 1
Neighbors of nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 2 and 5. Assign them to layer 2.
Nodes in layer 2:

makefile
Copy code
2: 2
5: 2
Neighbors of nodes in layer 2 that do not already belong to a layer are node 9. Assign it to layer 3.
Nodes in layer 3:

makefile
Copy code
9: 3
Neighbors of nodes in layer 3 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 6 and 10. Assign them to layer 4.
Nodes in layer 4:

makefile
Copy code
6: 4
10: 4
Neighbors of nodes in layer 4 that do not already belong to a layer are nodes 7 and 1 (already in layer 1) and nodes 3 and 8 (already in layer 2).
Nodes in layer 5:

makefile
Copy code
7: 5
There are no more nodes that are not assigned to a layer.

Final result:
