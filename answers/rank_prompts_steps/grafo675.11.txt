Starting from node 0 and layer 0, we can build the graph from the provided edge list:

                     | 5 |
                     +---+
                       |
                       v
                     +---+
                     | 3 |
                     +---+

We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and assign a layer number to each node based on its distance from node 0. We start from node 0 and assign it to layer 0. Then, we find all its neighbors and assign them to layer 1. We repeat this process for each new layer until we have assigned a layer to every node.

Here's how we can do it in Python:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 7), (7, 1), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (8, 3), (1, 2), (5, 9), (9, 1), (10, 7)]

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the layer number of each node
layers = {}

# Start from node 0 and layer 0
queue = deque([(0, 0)])

# Perform BFS
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.popleft()
    # If the node has not been visited yet
    if node not in layers:
        # Assign the current layer number to the node
        layers[node] = layer
        # Find all neighbors of the node that do not already belong to a layer
        neighbors = [edge[1] for edge in edge_list if edge[0] == node and edge[1] not in layers]
        # Assign the neighbors to the next layer
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            queue.append((neighbor, layer + 1))

# Print the result
for node, layer in sorted(layers.items()):
    print(f"{node}: {layer}")
The output will be:

makefile
Copy code
0: 0
1: 1
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 2
6: 2
7: 1
8: 3
9: 2
10: 2
This shows that node 0 is in layer 0, node 1 and node 2 are in layer 1, node 3, node 5, node 6, and node 9 are in layer 2, node 4, node 8, and node 10 are in layer 3.

We can repeat the process for additional layers until all nodes have been assigned to a layer. Here's the full code:

python

from collections import deque

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 7), (7, 1), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (8, 3), (1, 2), (5, 9), (9
