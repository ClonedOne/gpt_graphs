Starting from node 0, the graph can be represented as:

rust
Copy code
0 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6
|              |
v              v
8 <- 4      10 <- 1
^    ^      |   / | \
|    |      v  v  v  v
v    v     9  5  2  6 -> 7 -> 3
2    7
Using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can traverse the graph and assign each node to a layer based on its distance from node 0. We start with layer 0 for node 0, and assign increasing layer numbers to each node as we traverse the graph.

Here are the steps to find all nodes in each layer:

Start from node 0 with layer number 0
Find all neighbors of node 0, assign to layer 1
Find all neighbors of nodes in layer 1 that do not already belong to a layer, assign to layer 2
Repeat the process, incrementing the layer, until there are no more nodes that are not assigned to any layer
The final result will be a list of nodes and their corresponding layer numbers.

# Initialize the graph as a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors
graph = {}
for edge in edge_list:
    if edge[0] not in graph:
        graph[edge[0]] = []
    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])

# Initialize the BFS algorithm with node 0
queue = [(0, 0)]  # (node, layer)
visited = set()

# Traverse the graph with BFS
while queue:
    node, layer = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(node)

    # Find all neighbors of the current node
    neighbors = graph.get(node, [])
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        # If the neighbor has not been visited, assign it to the next layer
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, layer + 1))

    # Print the nodes in the current layer
    if layer not in layers:
        layers[layer] = []
    layers[layer].append(node)

# Print the final result
for layer, nodes in layers.items():
    for node in nodes:
        print(f"{node}: {layer}")
Output:

Note that the order of the nodes in each layer may vary, as BFS can traverse the graph in different orders depending on the implementation.
