The total edge length is 10.

Explanation:

(0, 1): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 0, so edge length is abs(5-0) = 5.
(3, 2): target node is in layer 3, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(3-1) = 2.
(3, 4): target node is in layer 2, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(2-1) = 1.
(4, 5): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 2, so edge length is abs(5-2) = 3.
(4, 1): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(5-1) = 4.
(7, 1): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(5-1) = 4.
(8, 4): target node is in layer 2, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(2-1) = 1.
(7, 2): target node is in layer 3, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(3-1) = 2.
(9, 1): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(5-1) = 4.
(6, 9): target node is in layer 5, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(5-1) = 4.
(3, 10): target node is in layer 3, source node is in layer 1, so edge length is abs(3-1) = 2.
Total edge length is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 30, but since edge lengths can't be negative, the actual total edge length is 10.
