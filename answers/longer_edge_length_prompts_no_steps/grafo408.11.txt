The total sum of edge lengths is 15.

Explanation:

Edge (7, 1) has length 4.
Edge (2, 6) has length 3.
Edge (5, 3) has length 2.
Edge (8, 4) has length 1.
Edge (3, 8) has length 1.
Edge (2, 7) has length 3.
Edge (0, 9) has length 4.
Edge (10, 8) has length 1.
Total edge length: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 15.
