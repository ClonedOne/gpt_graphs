First, listing every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: []

Layer 1: [8]
Neighbors of 8: [1, 2]

Layer 2: [1, 2]
Neighbors of 1: []
Neighbors of 2: [7, 6]

Layer 3: [7, 6]
Neighbors of 7: [3]
Neighbors of 6: [4]

Layer 4: [3, 4]
Neighbors of 3: []
Neighbors of 4: [9]

Layer 5: [9]
Neighbors of 9: [5]

Layer 6: [5]
Neighbors of 5: []

Next, writing the indices of each neighbor and the median of those indices:
Index of 1: 0
Index of 2: 1
Median of indices in layer 2: 0.5

Index of 7: 0
Index of 6: 1
Median of indices in layer 3: 0.5

Index of 3: 0
Index of 4: 1
Median of indices in layer 4: 0.5

Index of 9: 0
Median of indices in layer 5: 0

Index of 5: 0
Median of indices in layer 6: 0

Now, listing the nodes in each layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
8 -> 0.5

Layer 2:
1 -> 0
2 -> 0.5

Layer 3:
7 -> 0
6 -> 0.5

Layer 4:
3 -> 0
4 -> 0.5

Layer 5:
9 -> 0

Layer 6:
5 -> 0

Finally, listing the nodes in each layer, sorted by their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 5: [9]
Layer 6: [5]
Layer 1: [8]
Layer 2: [1, 2]
Layer 3: [7, 6]
Layer 4: [3, 4]
