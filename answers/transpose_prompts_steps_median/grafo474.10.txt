First, listing neighbors of nodes in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [6, 8, 7]
Index of 6: 0
Index of 8: 1
Index of 7: 2
Median of neighbors of 0: 1

Next, listing nodes and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 1

Layer 1:
6 -> 0
8 -> 1
7 -> 2

Layer 2:
1 -> NaN
2 -> NaN
5 -> NaN
3 -> NaN

Layer 3:
9 -> NaN

Layer 4:
4 -> NaN

Next, sorting nodes in each layer based on their associated median value:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [6, 8, 7]
Layer 2: [1, 2, 5, 3]
Layer 3: [9]
Layer 4: [4]
