First, let's list the neighbors of each node in layer 0 and their indices in the next layer:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 3, 10]
Index of 1: 0
Index of 3: 1
Index of 10: NaN

Median of indices: 0

Next, let's list the nodes in each layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0

Layer 1:
1 -> 0
3 -> 1
10 -> 0

Layer 2:
2 -> 0
7 -> 1
6 -> 2
4 -> 3
8 -> 4

Layer 3:
5 -> 0
9 -> 1

Finally, let's sort the nodes in each layer by their associated median:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [1, 3, 10]
Layer 2: [2, 7, 6, 8, 4]
Layer 3: [5, 9]
