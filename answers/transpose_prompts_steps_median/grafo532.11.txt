Here are the answers to the given questions:

List of neighbors in the next layer for each node in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [7, 6, 10]
Median of indices: 1

Nodes in each layer with their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 1.0

Layer 1:
7 -> 0.0
6 -> 3.0
10 -> 2.0

Layer 2:
1 -> 0.0
2 -> 1.0
9 -> 2.0
4 -> 3.0

Layer 3:
5 -> 1.0
8 -> 2.0

Layer 4:
3 -> 0.0

Sorted nodes in each layer according to their associated medians:
Layer 0:
[0]

Layer 1:
[7, 10, 6]

Layer 2:
[1, 2, 9, 4]

Layer 3:
[5, 8]

Layer 4:
[3]
