Here are the solutions to your questions:

List of neighbors for each node in layer 0:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [6]
Index of 6: 0
Median of indices: 0

List of nodes in every layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0
Layer 1:
6 -> 0

Layer 2:
1 -> 0

Layer 3:
7 -> 0

Layer 4:
2 -> 0
3 -> 0

Layer 5:
8 -> 0.5
9 -> 1.5

Layer 6:
4 -> 1
5 -> 2

Sorted nodes in each layer based on their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [6]
Layer 2: [1]
Layer 3: [7]
Layer 4: [2, 3]
Layer 5: [8, 9]
Layer 6: [4, 5]
