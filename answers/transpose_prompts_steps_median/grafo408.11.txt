First, we list the neighbors of nodes in layer 0 and their indices in the next layer:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [9]
Index of 9: 0

Then, we list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0
9 -> 0

Next, we sort the nodes in each layer by their associated median values:
Layer 0: [0, 9]

Final result:
Layer 0: [0, 9]
Layer 1: []
Layer 2: [7]
Layer 3: [1, 2]
Layer 4: [6, 10]
Layer 5: [8]
Layer 6: [4, 3]
Layer 7: [5]
