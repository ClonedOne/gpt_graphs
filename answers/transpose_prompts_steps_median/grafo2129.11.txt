First, let's list every node in layer 0 and its neighbors in the next layer:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [1, 3]

Index of 1: 0
Index of 3: 1

Median of indices: 0.5

Next, let's list the nodes in each layer with their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
1 -> 0
3 -> 1

Layer 2:
6 -> 0
4 -> 2
7 -> 3
8 -> 4
9 -> 5
2 -> 6

Layer 3:
5 -> 0
10 -> 3

Now, let's sort the nodes in each layer according to their associated medians:
Layer 0: [0]

Layer 1: [1, 3]

Layer 2: [6, 4, 7, 8, 9, 2]

Layer 3: [5, 10]
