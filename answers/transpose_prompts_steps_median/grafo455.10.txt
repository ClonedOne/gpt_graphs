First, listing the neighbors of nodes in layer 0:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [4, 6]

Index of 4: 0
Index of 6: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Next, listing the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5

Layer 1:
4 -> 0
6 -> 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Layer 2:
5 -> 0
2 -> 1.5
Median of indices: 0.75

Layer 3:
1 -> 0
8 -> 1
9 -> 2
Median of indices: 1

Layer 4:
7 -> 0
3 -> 1
Median of indices: 0.5

Finally, listing the sorted nodes in each layer according to their associated median values:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [4, 6]
Layer 2: [5, 2]
Layer 3: [1, 8, 9]
Layer 4: [7, 3]
