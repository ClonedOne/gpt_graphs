Here are the answers to each part of the question:

List every node in layer 0, and for each node list its neighbors in the next layer:
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [6, 7]

For every one of the neighbors, write their index in their layer and the median of the indices:
Index of 6: 0
Index of 7: 1
Median of indices: 0.5

List the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:
Layer 0:
0 -> 0.5
Layer 1:
6 -> 0
7 -> 1
Layer 2:
1 -> 0
2 -> 1
5 -> 2
10 -> 3
Layer 3:
9 -> 0
Layer 4:
8 -> 0.5
4 -> 1.5
Layer 5:
3 -> 0

Finally, list the nodes in the layers sorted by their associated median value:
Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [6, 7]
Layer 5: [3]
Layer 2: [1, 2, 5, 10]
Layer 3: [9]
Layer 4: [8, 4]
