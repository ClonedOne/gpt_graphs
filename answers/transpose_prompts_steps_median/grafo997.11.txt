Listing every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [7, 5, 8]

Index of 7: 0
Index of 5: 1
Index of 8: 2
Median of indices: 1

Index of 5: 0
Index of 7: 1
Index of 8: 2
Median of indices: 1

Index of 8: 0
Index of 7: 1
Index of 5: 2
Median of indices: 1

Nodes in every layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 1

Layer 1:
7 -> 0
5 -> 1
8 -> 2

Layer 2:
1 -> 1
2 -> 1.5
3 -> 2

Layer 3:
6 -> 1
9 -> 2
10 -> 3

Layer 4:
4 -> 0

Layers and the sorted nodes according to their associated median value:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [7, 5, 8]
Layer 2: [1, 2, 3]
Layer 3: [6, 9, 10]
Layer 4: [4]
