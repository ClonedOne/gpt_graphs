First, listing the neighbors of layer 0 nodes and their indices:

Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: []
Index of neighbor1: NaN

Now, listing the nodes in each layer and their associated medians:

Layer 0:
0 -> 0.0

Layer 1:
8 -> 0.0

Layer 2:
1 -> 0.0
2 -> 2.5

Layer 3:
7 -> 2.0
6 -> 3.5

Layer 4:
3 -> 4.0
4 -> 4.0

Layer 5:
9 -> 0.0

Layer 6:
5 -> 0.0

Finally, listing the layers and the sorted nodes in them:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [8]
Layer 5: [9]
Layer 6: [5]
Layer 2: [1, 2]
Layer 3: [7, 6]
Layer 4: [3, 4]
