First, we list every node in layer 0 and their neighbors in the next layer:

less
Copy code
Layer 0: [0]
Neighbors of 0: [6, 7, 8]

Next, we list the indices of the neighbors in their layer and calculate their median:

yaml
Copy code
Index of 6: 0
Index of 7: 1
Index of 8: 2

Median of indices: 1
So the associated median for node 0 is 1.

Now we list the nodes in every layer and their associated medians:

rust
Copy code
Layer 0:
0 -> 1

Layer 1:
6 -> 3
7 -> 2
8 -> 3

Layer 2:
1 -> 0
2 -> 1
5 -> 2
3 -> 3
9 -> 4

Layer 3:
4 -> 2

Layer 4:
10 -> 0
Finally, we sort the nodes in the layers based on their associated median:

less
Copy code
Layer 0: [0]

Layer 1: [7, 6, 8]

Layer 2: [1, 2, 5, 3, 9]

Layer 3: [4]

Layer 4: [10]
