Based on the given arrays and list of edges, we can construct the following bipartite graph:

    10        4
     |         |
     8         9
Since there is only one edge in the list of edges, we can stop here and write 0, as requested.

If there were more edges, we would continue as follows:

Excluding pairs with the same first element, we are left with the pairs [(4, 8), (4, 9)].
Excluding pairs with the same second element, we are still left with the same pairs.
For the pair (4, 8), (4, 9), we have s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, and t2=1.
Since s1=s2, we exclude this pair and are left with no pairs.
The final answer is 0.
