To count the number of edge crossings in a bipartite graph given the arrays A and B, and the list of edges in the format specified in the question, we can follow the steps outlined below:

First, we check if there is a single edge, or if either array A or B has length 1, in which case the number of edge crossings is 0. In this case, we write 0 and stop writing.

Next, we consider all combinations of pairs of edges and exclude those that have the same first or second element. Let's call the resulting list of pairs of edges "edge_pairs".

Copy code
A = [7, 6, 10]
B = [1, 2, 9, 4]
edges = [(7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 9), (10, 1), (10, 4)]

if len(edges) == 1 or len(A) == 1 or len(B) == 1:
    print(0)
else:
    edge_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(edges)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):
            if edges[i][0] != edges[j][0] and edges[i][1] != edges[j][1]:
                edge_pairs.append((edges[i], edges[j]))
Next, for every pair of edges left in "edge_pairs", we find the indices s1, t1, s2, and t2 as specified in the question, and exclude pairs that satisfy the conditions s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. We then count the number of remaining edge pairs and output this as the number of edge crossings.

Copy code
count = 0
for i in range(len(edge_pairs)):
    e1, e2 = edge_pairs[i]
    s1, t1 = A.index(e1[0]), B.index(e1[1])
    s2, t2 = A.index(e2[0]), B.index(e2[1])
    if not (s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2):
        count += 1

print(count)
Putting it all together, the code to count the number of edge crossings is:

less
Copy code
A = [7, 6, 10]
B = [1, 2, 9, 4]
edges = [(7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 9), (10, 1), (10, 4)]

if len(edges) == 1 or len(A) == 1 or len(B) == 1:
    print(0)
else:
    edge_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(edges)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):
            if edges[i][0] != edges[j][0] and edges[i][1] != edges[j][1]:
                edge_pairs.append((edges[i], edges[j]))
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(edge_pairs)):
        e1, e2 = edge_pairs[i]
        s1, t1 = A.index(e1[0]), B.index(e1[1])
        s2, t2 = A.index(e2[0]), B.index(e2[1])
        if not (s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2):
            count += 1
    
    print(count)
In this case, the output is 3, which is the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph defined by the
