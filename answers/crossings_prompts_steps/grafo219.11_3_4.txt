First, we can see that there are two edges in the list, so we need to continue with the analysis.

Array A has length 4, and array B has length 1, so we can continue with the analysis.

The list of edges, after excluding any single-edge and the edges that have the same first or second element, is:

[(5, 10), (7, 10)]

There is only one pair of edges left, so we can proceed to compute s1, t1, s2, and t2 for this pair.

Pair (5, 10), (7, 10):
s1 = 1, t1 = 2, s2 = 3, t2 = 2

There is only one pair left, so we can skip the next two exclusion steps.

The final list of pairs is:
[(5, 10), (7, 10)]

There are 2 edges left, so the answer is 2.
