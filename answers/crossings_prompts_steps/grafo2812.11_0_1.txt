Based on the given arrays and edges, there is only one edge in the graph. Therefore, the number of edge crossings is 0.

Note: the conditions given in the beginning, where if there is a single edge, or if array A has length 1, or if array B has length 1, the result is 0, is sufficient to determine that the number of edge crossings is 0 without needing to go through the subsequent steps of the algorithm.
