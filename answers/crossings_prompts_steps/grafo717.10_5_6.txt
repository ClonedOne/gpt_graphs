Given A = [9] and B = [5], and Tuples = [(9, 5)], we have a single edge and thus the answer is 0.

Note: Since array A has length 1, there cannot be any other edge that intersects with this edge, and hence there is no possibility of any edge crossing in the bipartite graph. Therefore, the answer is 0.
