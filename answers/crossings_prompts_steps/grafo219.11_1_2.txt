First, let's write down all the pairs of edges, excluding those with the same first or second element:

Pairs of edges:

(1, 6) and (1, 8)
(1, 6) and (1, 2)
(1, 6) and (1, 9)
(1, 8) and (1, 2)
(1, 8) and (1, 9)
(1, 2) and (1, 9)
Next, we'll write down s1, t1, s2, and t2 for each pair of edges:

(1, 6) and (1, 8) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 2
(1, 6) and (1, 2) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 0
(1, 6) and (1, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
(1, 8) and (1, 2) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 0
(1, 8) and (1, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 2, s2 = 0, t2 = 3
(1, 2) and (1, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 3

Now we'll exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, and pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

Pairs of edges left:

(1, 6) and (1, 8)
(1, 6) and (1, 9)
(1, 8) and (1, 9)
There are 3 pairs of edges left, so the answer is 3.
