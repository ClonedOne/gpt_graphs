First, we need to determine if there is only one edge or if either A or B has a length of 1. If so, the answer is 0 and we can stop:

A has length 1: 0
B has length 1: 0
There is only one edge: 0
Since there is more than one edge and both A and B have a length greater than 1, we need to consider all pairs of edges and follow the steps given:

First, we exclude all the pairs that have the same first element or the same second element:
Pairs: [(5, 1), (2, 8)]
Pairs without shared first or second element: [(5, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9)]

Now we need to consider each pair of edges and write down s1, t1, s2, and t2:
(5, 1), (2, 8) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 1
(5, 1), (2, 9) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 2
(2, 8), (2, 9) => s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 2

Next, we exclude pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, and pairs where s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
Pairs without shared first or second element and with valid s/t values: [(5, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9)]

Finally, we count the remaining number of edges, which is 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.
