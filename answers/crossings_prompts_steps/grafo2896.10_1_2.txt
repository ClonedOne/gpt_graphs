First, we can see that there is a single edge, so the answer is 0 and we can stop writing.

If there were multiple edges, we would proceed with the remaining instructions as follows:

First, exclude pairs that have the same first element. In this case, there is only one pair so we don't need to do anything.
Next, exclude pairs that have the same second element. Again, there is only one pair so we don't need to do anything.
Now we have only one pair left: (8, 3), (5, 1). We need to consider s1, t1, s2, and t2 for this pair.
For the first edge (8, 3), s1 = 0 (the index of 8 in array A) and t1 = 1 (the index of 3 in array B).
For the second edge (5, 1), s2 = 1 (the index of 5 in array A) and t2 = 0 (the index of 1 in array B).
We need to exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2. This is not the case for the only pair we have, so we don't need to exclude anything.
We also need to exclude pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. This is also not the case for the only pair we have, so we don't need to exclude anything.
We are left with only one edge after applying all the exclusions, so the answer is 1.
