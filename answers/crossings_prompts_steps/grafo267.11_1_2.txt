There are 6 edges in the given list.

First, we check if there is only one edge or if either of the arrays has length 1. Since there is more than one edge, and neither of the arrays has length 1, we can continue.

Next, we exclude all pairs of edges that have the same first element or the same second element:
[(6, 1), (7, 5)]
[(6, 2), (8, 3)]
[(7, 3), (8, 9)]

There are three pairs of edges left. For each pair, we calculate s1, t1, s2, and t2:
(6, 1) => s1=0, t1=1, s2=1, t2=2
(6, 2) => s1=0, t1=2, s2=2, t2=1
(7, 3) => s1=1, t1=3, s2=2, t2=1

We exclude the pairs that satisfy the conditions s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
(6, 1) and (6, 2) satisfy s1 < s2 and t1 > t2
(6, 2) and (7, 3) satisfy s1 > s2 and t1 < t2

Therefore, the only remaining pair of edges is (6, 1) and (7, 3), and there is one edge crossing between them. Hence, the answer is 1.
