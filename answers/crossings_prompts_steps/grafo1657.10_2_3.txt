First, we can see that array B has length 1, so the answer is 0 and we can stop.

If we had more than one edge, we would proceed as follows:

List of edges with different first elements: [(2, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)]
List of edges with different second elements: [(4, 5), (6, 5)]
Now we consider all pairs of edges left, excluding those with the same first or second element:

(2, 5), (4, 5) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=3, t2=0
(2, 5), (6, 5) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=5, t2=0
(2, 5), (7, 5) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=1, t2=0
(2, 5), (8, 5) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=4, t2=0
(2, 5), (9, 5) => s1=0, t1=0, s2=2, t2=0
(4, 5), (6, 5) => s1=3, t1=0, s2=5, t2=0
(4, 5), (7, 5) => s1=3, t1=0, s2=1, t2=0
(4, 5), (8, 5) => s1=3, t1=0, s2=4, t2=0
(4, 5), (9, 5) => s1=3, t1=0, s2=2, t2=0
(6, 5), (7, 5) => s1=5, t1=0, s2=1, t2=0
(6, 5), (8, 5) => s1=5, t1=0, s2=4, t2=0
(6, 5), (9, 5) => s1=5, t1=0, s2=2, t2=0
(7, 5), (8, 5) => s1=1, t1=0, s2=4, t2=0
(7, 5), (9, 5) => s1=1, t1=0, s2=2, t2=0
(8, 5), (9, 5) => s1=4, t1=0, s2=2, t2=0
Next, we exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, and pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

(2, 5), (4, 5)
(2, 5), (6, 5)
(2, 5), (8, 5)
(4, 5), (6, 5)
(4, 5), (8, 5)
(6, 5), (8, 5)
There are 6 edges left, so the answer is 6.
