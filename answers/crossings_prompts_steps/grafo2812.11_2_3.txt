Given the arrays A = [1] and B = [7, 8], and the list of edges tuples = [(1, 7), (1, 8)], we can follow the steps to count the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph:

Step 1: As there is a single edge, we write 0 and stop writing.

The answer is 0.

Note: If array A had length 1, or array B had length 1, we would have written 0 and stopped writing as well.

If there were more edges, we would proceed with the following steps:

Step 2: Exclude all pairs with the same first element. We are left with:

[(1, 7), (1, 8)]

Step 3: Exclude all pairs with the same second element. We are left with:

[(1, 7), (1, 8)]

Step 4: For each remaining pair of edges, write down s1, t1, s2, and t2. We have only one pair of edges, so we write:

(1, 7), (1, 8) => s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 2

Step 5: Exclude all pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2. We have only one pair of edges, so this step does not apply.

Step 6: Exclude all pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. We have only one pair of edges, so this step does not apply.

Step 7: Write the number of edges left as a number. We have only one pair of edges left, so the answer is 1.

Therefore, the number of edge crossings in the bipartite graph for the given data is 0.
