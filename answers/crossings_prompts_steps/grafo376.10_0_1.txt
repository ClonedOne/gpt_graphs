Based on the given arrays and edges, there is only a single edge in the bipartite graph, so the number of edge crossings is 0.

Note: The instructions for considering all combinations of edge pairs, excluding pairs with the same first or second elements, and filtering pairs based on the indices of their elements are only relevant if there are at least two edges in the graph.
