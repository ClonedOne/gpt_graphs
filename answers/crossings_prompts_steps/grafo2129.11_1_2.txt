First, let's check the conditions for a quick answer. Since there is more than one edge and both arrays A and B have a length greater than 1, we cannot give a quick answer and must continue with the full procedure.

Excluding pairs with the same first element, we have:

[(3, 2), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)]

Excluding pairs with the same second element, we have:

[(3, 2), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)]

Now we need to consider all the possible pairs of edges, excluding pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. We get:

(3, 2), (1, 6)
(3, 2), (1, 4)
(3, 2), (1, 7)
(3, 2), (1, 8)
(3, 2), (1, 9)
(1, 6), (1, 4)
(1, 6), (1, 7)
(1, 6), (1, 8)
(1, 6), (1, 9)
(1, 4), (1, 7)
(1, 4), (1, 8)
(1, 4), (1, 9)
(1, 7), (1, 8)
(1, 7), (1, 9)
(1, 8), (1, 9)

We don't have any pairs where s1 > s2 and t1 < t2 or s1 < s2 and t1 > t2, so we don't need to exclude any pairs.

Therefore, there are 15 pairs of edges left, which means there are 15 edge crossings in the bipartite graph.
