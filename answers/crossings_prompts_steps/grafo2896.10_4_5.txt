The given arrays are A = [9] and B = [2], and the given list of edges is [(9, 2)].

Since there is only one edge, the answer is 0 and we can stop here.

Note: If array A or B had length 1, we would also stop here and return 0, since there would not be any edges to form pairs with.

However, for the sake of completeness, let's continue with the steps described in the prompt.

We exclude all pairs that have the same first element. There is only one edge, so this step is not applicable.

We exclude all pairs that have the same second element. There is only one edge, so this step is also not applicable.

We consider all pairs of edges left. Since there is only one edge left, this step is also not applicable.

We exclude all pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2. Since there is only one edge left, this step is not applicable.

We exclude all pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2. Since there is only one edge left, this step is also not applicable.

Therefore, the final answer is 0, since there is only one edge and we cannot form any pairs of edges.
