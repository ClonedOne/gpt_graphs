First, let's exclude the cases where there is only one edge or one of the arrays has length 1, as instructed:

There is more than one edge, so we keep going.
Array A has more than one element, so we keep going.
Array B has more than one element, so we keep going.
Next, let's exclude the pairs that have the same first element and the pairs that have the same second element:

Pairs with the same first element: [(6, 5), (6, 10)].
Pairs with the same second element: [(4, 10)].
Now, let's consider every pair of edges left:

(4, 5) and (6, 5): (4,5) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 0; (6,5) => s1 = 2, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 0.
(4, 5) and (4, 10): (4,5) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1; (4,10) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1.
(6, 5) and (4, 10): (6,5) => s1 = 2, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1; (4,10) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 1.
Next, let's exclude the pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, and s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:

(4, 5) and (6, 5): s1 < s2 and t1 < t2, so we keep this pair.
(4, 5) and (4, 10): s1 = s2, so we exclude this pair.
(6, 5) and (4, 10): s1 > s2 and t1 > t2, so we exclude this pair.
Therefore, we are left with only one edge pair that satisfies all the conditions, which is (4, 5) and (6, 5). Hence, the number of edges left is 1.
