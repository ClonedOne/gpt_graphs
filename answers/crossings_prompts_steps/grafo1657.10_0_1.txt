Based on the given arrays A and B, and the list of edges, the pairs of edges are:

(0, 1), (0, 3)

Since there are only two edges, we can stop here and return 0, as per the first condition.

However, if we continue, we can find the pairs with different first and second elements:

Pairs with different first elements:
(0, 1), (0, 3)

Pairs with different second elements:
(0, 1), (0, 3)

Next, we need to consider every pair of edges left and write down s1, t1, s2, and t2:

(0, 1), (0, 3) => s1 = 0, t1 = 1, s2 = 0, t2 = 3

Now, we need to exclude the pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2, which in this case is none.

We also need to exclude the pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2, which in this case is also none.

Therefore, there is only one pair of edges left after applying all the conditions, and the number of edges left is 1.
