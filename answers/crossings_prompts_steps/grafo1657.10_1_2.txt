First, let's check if any of the special cases apply. Since there are multiple edges, we don't stop at 0.

Both arrays have length greater than 1, so we can continue.

We'll start by excluding pairs with the same first element:
[(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9)]
becomes:
[(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9)]

Next, we'll exclude pairs with the same second element:
[(1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9)]
becomes:
[(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4)]

Now we'll consider all pairs of edges and write down s1, t1, s2, and t2 for each pair:
(1, 7) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, t2=7
(1, 6) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, t2=6
(1, 4) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, t2=4
(1, 8) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, t2=8
(1, 9) => s1=1, t1=2, s2=1, t2=9
(3, 2) => s1=3, t1=2, s2=1, t2=7
(3, 2) => s1=3, t1=2, s2=1, t2=6
(3, 2) => s1=3, t1=2, s2=1, t2=4
(3, 2) => s1=3, t1=2, s2=1, t2=8
(3, 2) => s1=3, t1=2, s2=1, t2=9
(1, 6) => s1=1, t1=7, s2=1, t2=4
(1, 6) => s1=1, t1=7, s2=3, t2=2
(1, 6) => s1=1, t1=6, s2=1, t2=4
(1, 6) => s1=1, t1=6, s2=3, t2=2
(1, 4) => s1=1, t1=7, s2=1, t2=4
(1, 4) => s1=1, t1=7, s2=3, t2=4
(1, 4) => s1=1, t1=6, s2=1, t2=4
(1, 4) => s1=1, t1=6, s2=3, t
