First, we can create a bipartite graph with nodes from arrays A and B, and connect nodes between A and B according to the given list of edges. The resulting bipartite graph looks like:

lua
Copy code
   7   6
   |   |
   3---4
Next, we can follow the steps outlined in the prompt to count the number of edge crossings in this graph.

First, we exclude pairs of edges that have the same first element or the same second element. After this step, the list of edges becomes:

css
Copy code
[(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
Next, we consider every pair of edges left and record the indices of their corresponding elements in arrays A and B. For example, for the pair of edges (7, 3) and (6, 3), we have:

scss
Copy code
(7, 3) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 0
(6, 3) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 0
We exclude the pair (7, 3) and (6, 3) because s1 > s2 and t1 < t2.

For the remaining pair of edges, (6, 3) and (6, 4), we have:

scss
Copy code
(6, 3) => s1 = 1, t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = 1
(6, 4) => s1 = 1, t1 = 1, s2 = 1, t2 = 0
We exclude the pair (6, 3) and (6, 4) because s1 < s2 and t1 > t2.

Therefore, there are no edge crossings in this graph, and the number of edges left is 0.
