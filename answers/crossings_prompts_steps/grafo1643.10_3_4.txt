Given the arrays A = [2] and B = [7], and the edges Tuples = [(2, 7)], there is only one edge. Therefore, the answer is 0, and we can stop writing.

However, if there were multiple edges, we would follow the steps as described. If the length of A or B is 1, the answer would be 0, and we would stop writing.

Assuming that both A and B have a length greater than 1, we would proceed with the following steps:

Consider all combinations of edge pairs and exclude pairs with the same first or second element.
[(2, 7)]

For every remaining pair of edges, consider the indices of the first and second elements in arrays A and B as instructed:
(2, 7) => s1 = 0, t1 = 0, s2 = 0, t2 = 0

Exclude pairs for which s1 > s2 and t1 < t2:
(2, 7) is the only pair left, and we can keep it.

Exclude pairs for which s1 < s2 and t1 > t2:
There are no more pairs left, so we can stop.

Therefore, the number of edges left is 1.
