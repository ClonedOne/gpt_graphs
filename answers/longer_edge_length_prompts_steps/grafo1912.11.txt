For each edge, we can determine the layer of the source node and the layer of the target node using the provided layer mapping.

(0, 1): layer of source node is 0, layer of target node is 3
(1, 2): layer of source node is 3, layer of target node is 4
(3, 2): layer of source node is 2, layer of target node is 4
(0, 3): layer of source node is 0, layer of target node is 2
(7, 6): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 4
(7, 1): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 3
(1, 6): layer of source node is 3, layer of target node is 4
(4, 1): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 3
(4, 3): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 2
(1, 8): layer of source node is 3, layer of target node is 5
(2, 8): layer of source node is 4, layer of target node is 5
(2, 5): layer of source node is 4, layer of target node is 5
(9, 5): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 5
(9, 6): layer of source node is 1, layer of target node is 4
(3, 10): layer of source node is 2, layer of target node is 4
(1, 10): layer of source node is 3, layer of target node is 4
(0, 10): layer of source node is 0, layer of target node is 4
Next, we can calculate the length of each edge using the provided formula.

(0, 1): length is abs(3 - 0) = 3
(1, 2): length is abs(4 - 3) = 1
(3, 2): length is abs(4 - 2) = 2
(0, 3): length is abs(2 - 0) = 2
(7, 6): length is abs(4 - 1) = 3
(7, 1): length is abs(3 - 1) = 2
(1, 6): length is abs(4 - 3) = 1
(4, 1): length is abs(3 - 1) = 2
(4, 3): length is abs(2 - 1) = 1
(1, 8): length is abs(5 - 3) = 2
(2, 8): length is abs(5 - 4) = 1
(2, 5): length is abs(
