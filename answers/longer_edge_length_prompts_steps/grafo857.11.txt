For each edge, we can look at the layers of the source and target nodes to determine their positions within the layered graph. Using the mapping of layers to nodes given in the prompt, we can determine the layer for each node.

The layers for each edge are:

(7, 1): Layer 2 -> Layer 3
(6, 1): Layer 2 -> Layer 3
(2, 6): Layer 1 -> Layer 2
(2, 5): Layer 1 -> Layer 2
(3, 8): Layer 2 -> Layer 5
(7, 9): Layer 2 -> Layer 4
(0, 9): Layer 0 -> Layer 4
(10, 5): Layer 1 -> Layer 5
Next, we can compute the length for each edge, as described in the prompt:

Edge (7, 1) has length |3 - 2| = 1
Edge (6, 1) has length |3 - 2| = 1
Edge (2, 6) has length |2 - 1| = 1
Edge (2, 5) has length |2 - 1| = 1
Edge (3, 8) has length |5 - 2| = 3
Edge (7, 9) has length |4 - 2| = 2
Edge (0, 9) has length |4 - 0| = 4
Edge (10, 5) has length |5 - 1| = 4
The total sum of the lengths is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 17.

Therefore, the final sum is 17.
