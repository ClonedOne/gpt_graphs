The layer of the source node is the layer containing the node with the source_id of the edge, and similarly for the target node. Here are the layers of each node:

Layer 0: [0]
Layer 1: [3]
Layer 2: [2, 6]
Layer 3: []
Layer 4: [5, 8, 9]
Layer 5: [1, 4, 7, 10]

Now we can calculate the length of each edge using the formula provided in the prompt. Here are the lengths of each edge:

(0, 6): 2 (from layer 0 to layer 2)
(6, 1): -4 (from layer 2 to layer 5)
(2, 7): 3 (from layer 2 to layer 5)
(3, 8): 4 (from layer 1 to layer 4)
(0, 5): 4 (from layer 0 to layer 4)
(9, 7): -2 (from layer 4 to layer 5)
(6, 9): 2 (from layer 2 to layer 4)
(5, 10): 1 (from layer 4 to layer 5)
(8, 10): 1 (from layer 4 to layer 5)

The total sum of the lengths is 15.

Therefore, the final answer is:

15
