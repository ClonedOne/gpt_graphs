Based on the provided description, we can visualize the layered graph as follows:

rust
Copy code
Layer 0: 0
Layer 1: 10
Layer 2: 4
Layer 3: 2  9
Layer 4: 1  6  7
Layer 5: 3  5  8

Edges:
0 -> 9 (length 3-0 = 3)
0 -> 4 (length 2-0 = 2)
4 -> 1 (length 4-2 = 2)
6 -> 3 (length 5-3 = 2)
1 -> 5 (length 5-4 = 1)
2 -> 5 (length 5-3 = 2)
1 -> 8 (length 5-4 = 1)
10 -> 2 (length 3-1 = 2)
4 -> 2 (length 3-2 = 1)
9 -> 3 (length 5-3 = 2)

Total edge length: 18
Therefore, the total edge length is 18.
